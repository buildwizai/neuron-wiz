# AI Key Concepts

## General-Purpose AI
  - Development
    - **Deep Learning**
      - Neural Networks
        - Layers of interconnected nodes
        - Weights updated through training
    - **Data Collection and Pre-processing**
      - Cleaning and labeling
      - Filtering harmful content
      - Addressing copyright and privacy concerns
    - **Training**
      - Using large datasets
    - **Deployment**
    - **Monitoring**
  - Capabilities
    - **Multiple Modalities**
      - Text, Audio, Images, Video, Code, Robotic actions, Molecules, Time series data, Music
    - Interactive dialogue
    - Generate text, images, audio, video, code
    - Reasoning and problem-solving
  - Challenges
    - Data Scarcity
      - Internet text data may be exhausted by 2030
      - Multimodal data as a solution
      - Synthetic data utility is mixed
    - **Compute power**
    - Power and chip production constraints
    - **Breadth of Use Cases**
    - **Understanding Internal Functionality**
    - Autonomous agents can increase risks
    - **Rapid Proliferation and Impact**

## Risk Management
  - **Risk Identification and Assessment**
    - Early stages of risk management
    - Use of risk taxonomies
    - Difficult due to many domains and changing capabilities
    -  Need for evaluations across languages, cultures, modalities and use cases
  - Methods
    - **Model Testing**
      - Benchmarks, standardized tests, metrics
        - Vary in quality
        - Limited in real-world use
    - **Red Teaming**
      -  Adversarial attacks
      -  Identify vulnerabilities
      -  Can be labor intensive
    - Safety Cases
    - Defence in depth model
  - Challenges
    - Limited access to models
    - Lack of resources and time for evaluation
    - Conflicts of interest
    - Need for diverse perspectives

## Model Sharing
  - **Open-weight**
    - Model weights are publicly available
  - **Open source**
    - Model weights, data, and code are available without use restrictions
  - Spectrum of model sharing
    - Fully closed to fully open

## Technical Challenges
  - Autonomous agents increase risks
  - Breadth of use cases complicates safety assurance
  - Limited understanding of internal model operations
  - Persistence of harmful behaviors
  - Insufficient safety evaluations
  - Rapid proliferation and impact
