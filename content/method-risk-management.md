## Risk Management Methods

  - **Risk Identification**
    - **Risk Taxonomies**
      - Categorize and organize risks
      - Help conceptualize and specify risks
    - **Engagement with Experts and Communities**
      -  Involve domain experts, users, and impacted communities
      -  Gather diverse insights
    - **Delphi Method**
      - Gather consensus from expert panels
    - **Threat Modeling**
      - Identify system threats and vulnerabilities
    - **Scenario Analysis**
      - Develop and analyze plausible future scenarios
  - **Risk Assessment**
    - **Impact Assessments**
       - Assess the potential impacts of AI systems
    - **Audits**
      - Review compliance with standards and policies
    - **Evaluations**
      - Systematic assessments of performance, capabilities, and vulnerabilities
        - Benchmarking
        - Red-teaming
        - Field testing
    - **Risk Matrices**
      - Prioritize risks by likelihood and impact
  - **Risk Mitigation**
    - **Training More Trustworthy Models**
      - Focus on safety during training
      - Use of methods to remove harmful capabilities
      - Adversarial training to improve model reliability
    - **Safety by Design**
      - Center user safety in design and development
    - **'Safety of the Intended Function' (SOTIF)**
      - Provide evidence that a system is safe when operating as intended
    - **Defense in Depth**
      - Layer multiple protective measures
      - Apply to data, infrastructure, developers, and users
    - **If-Then Commitments**
      - Implement protocols to manage risks at varying capability levels
  - **Monitoring and Intervention**
    - **Anomaly Detection**
      - Detect anomalous inputs and behaviors
    - **Human-in-the-Loop**
      - Include humans for oversight and manual overrides
    - **Watermarking**
      - Embed patterns to indicate AI-generated content
    - **Digital Forensics**
      - Trace the origin of digital media
  - **Risk Governance**
    - **Documentation**
      - Track training data, model design, and functionality
      - Model cards and system cards
    - **Risk Registers**
      - Repository of risks, prioritization, and mitigation plans
    - **Whistleblower Protection**
      -  Incentives and protections for reporting risks
    - **Incident Reporting**
      - Document and share cases of AI-caused harm
    - **Risk Management Frameworks**
      - Ensure cohesive structure, clear roles, and accountability
      - Apply Three Lines of Defense framework
  - **Model Release Strategies**
    - Staged releases
    - API access for greater control
    - Deployment safety controls
    - Responsible AI licenses
    - Acceptable use policies
  - **Other Techniques**
    -  Safety Cases
        - Structured argument supported by evidence
    -  ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable)
        - Keeping risk as low as possible
    -  Human Rights Impact Assessments
        - Assess impacts on human rights
