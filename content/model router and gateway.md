# Model Router and Gateway

## Model Router
- **Purpose:** Directs queries to appropriate models or solutions.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Specialized solutions** for different query types.
  - **Cost savings** by routing simpler queries to cheaper models.
- **Components:**
  - **Intent Classifier:** Predicts user's intent.
    - Routes query based on intent.
    - Can help avoid out-of-scope conversations.
  - **Next-action predictor:** Determines next action.
    - May ask for clarification for ambiguous queries.
- **Implementation**
  - Can be general-purpose or specialized models.
  - Specialized models are typically smaller and faster.
- **Context adjustment**
  - Manages context length when routing queries to different models.

## Model Gateway
- **Purpose:** Provides a unified and secure interface for accessing different models.
- **Functionality:**
  - **Unified API Access:** Allows access to different models (self-hosted or third-party) through the same interface.
  - **Access Control and Cost Management:** Centralized access control and usage monitoring.
  - **Fallback Policies:** Routes requests to alternative models during API failures, ensures smooth operation.
  - **Load Balancing, Logging, and Analytics:** Additional functionalities at the gateway.
- **Implementation:**
  - A unified wrapper that abstracts different model APIs.
  - Can implement fine-grained access controls and cost limits.
- **Benefits:**
  - Easier code maintenance, reduces need to update all applications if model API changes.
  - Centralized and controlled access, avoids sharing API keys.
  - Enables monitoring and limiting API calls, preventing abuse and managing costs effectively.
- **Off-the-shelf Gateways:** Many options available (Portkey, MLflow AI Gateway etc).
- **Routing & Scoring:** Like scoring, routing is in the model gateway.
- **Model size**: Models used for routing are typically smaller than models used for generation.
