# AI Pipeline Orchestration
## Core Concepts
  - **Purpose:** Specifies how different components are combined to create an end-to-end application flow.
  - **Functionality:** Manages the chaining of components like models, databases, and actions.
  - **Abstraction:** Abstracts away critical details of system operation.
## Key Steps
  - **Component Definition:**
    - Involves specifying all components used in the system.
    - Includes models for generation, routing, and scoring.
    - Integrates databases for data retrieval and various system actions.
    - Direct integration with model gateways can simplify model onboarding.
    - Supports integration with tools for evaluation and monitoring.
  - **Chaining (Pipelining):**
    - Defines the sequence of steps from receiving a user query to completing the task.
    - Involves function composition of components.
    - The orchestrator passes data between steps, ensuring format compatibility.
## Example Pipeline
  - Process the raw query.
  - Retrieve relevant data.
  - Combine the query and data to create a model prompt.
  - Generate a response with the model.
  - Evaluate the response.
  - Return a good response or route to a human.
## Design Considerations
  - **Parallel Processing:** Try to perform as much processing in parallel as possible, especially for latency-sensitive applications.
  - **Data Handling:** Ensure proper data formatting and transfer between steps.
## Evaluation of Orchestrators
  - **Integration and Extensibility:**
    - Ensure the orchestrator supports the components you are using or might adopt.
    - Check how easy it is to add or modify components if needed.
  - **Support for Complex Pipelines:**
    -  Must manage complex pipelines involving multiple steps and conditional logic.
    - Should support branching, parallel processing, and error handling.
  - **Ease of Use, Performance, and Scalability:**
    - Should have intuitive APIs, comprehensive documentation, and community support.
    - Should not introduce latency or hidden API calls.
    - Ensure that the system can scale as applications, developers, and traffic grow.
## Important Notes
  - Start building your application without an orchestrator first.
  - Orchestrators add complexity and can hide critical system details.
  - Only adopt orchestrators when you see clear benefits in later stages of development.
