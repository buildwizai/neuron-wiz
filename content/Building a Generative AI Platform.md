# Building a Generative AI Platform

## Core Components

### Enhance Context
- **RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
  - Retriever (Term-based, Embedding-based, Hybrid)
  - Generator (Language Model)
  - Document Chunking
- RAGs with Tabular Data
  - Text-to-SQL
  - SQL Execution
  - Generation
- Agentic RAGs
  - External Actions (Web Search, etc.)
  - Read-only vs. Write actions
- Query Rewriting

### Put in Guardrails
- Input Guardrails
  - Leaking Private Information
    - Sensitive Data Detection
    - Data Masking
  - Model Jailbreaking
    - Out-of-scope topic filtering
    - Anomaly Detection
- Output Guardrails
  - Output Quality Measurement
    - Empty Responses
    - Malformatted Responses
    - Toxic Responses
    - Factual Inconsistencies
    - Sensitive Information
    - Brand-risk Responses
    - Generally bad responses
  - Failure Management
    - Retry Logic
    - Parallel Calls
    - Human Fallback
- Guardrail Tradeoffs
  - Reliability vs. Latency
  - Self-hosted vs. Third-party API

### Add Model Router and Gateway
- Router
  - Intent Classifier
  - Next-action predictor
- Gateway
  - Unified API access
  - Access control and cost management
  - Fallback policies
  - Load balancing, logging, and analytics

### Reduce Latency with Cache
- Prompt Cache
  - Reusing overlapping text segments
- Exact Cache
  - Storing processed items for reuse
  - Database implementation
  - Eviction policies
- Semantic Cache
  - Embedding-based similarity
  - Vector Database

### Add Complex Logic and Write Actions
- Complex Logic
  - Conditional Output Passing
- Write Actions
  - Data source manipulation
  - Automation
  - Prompt injection

## Observability

### Metrics
- System Metrics
- Model Metrics
  - Accuracy, toxicity, hallucination rate
  - Context relevance, context precision
  - Timeouts, empty/malformatted responses
- Length-related Metrics
  - Query, context, response length
- Latency
  - TTFT, TBT, TPS, TPOT, Total Latency
- Cost-related Metrics
- Spot Checks vs. Exhaustive Checks
- Breakdown by relevant axes

### Logs
- Log everything (configurations, queries, outputs, etc.)
- Automated log analysis
- Manual inspection of production data

### Traces
- Step-by-step query execution path
- Identification of failure points

## AI Pipeline Orchestration
- Component Definition
- Chaining (Pipelining)
- Parallel Processing
- Evaluation of Orchestrators
  - Integration and extensibility
  - Support for complex pipelines
  - Ease of use, performance, and scalability
