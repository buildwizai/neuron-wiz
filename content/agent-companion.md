# AI Agents Companion

## Introduction
- Generative AI agents: dynamic problem-solving
- Definition: perceive environment, act strategically with tools
- Synthesis: reasoning, logic, external information
- Autonomous operation: pursue goals independently

## Agent Ops
- Efficient operationalization of Agents
- Subcategory of GenAIOps
- Main components:
    - Internal and external tool management
    - Agent brain prompt (goal, profile, instructions)
    - Orchestration
    - Memory
    - Task decomposition
- Requires DevOps and MLOps best practices

## Agent Success Metrics
- Critical for building, monitoring, and comparing agents
- Business metrics: north star (e.g., revenue, engagement)
- Goal completion rate: key metric
- Critical tasks/interactions: instrument and measure
- Application telemetry: latency, errors, etc.
- Human feedback: üëçüëé, user feedback
- Detailed observability: traces for debugging

## Agent Evaluation
- Essential for production-ready agents
- Focus beyond final output to decision-making process

### Assessing Agent Capabilities
- Core abilities: instruction understanding, logical reasoning
- Public benchmarks: model performance, hallucinations, tool calling, planning
- Consider inherited behaviors from LLMs and other components
- Holistic benchmarks: end-to-end performance

### Evaluating Trajectory and Tool Use
- Analyze steps taken: tool choice, strategies, efficiency
- Trajectory: sequence of actions
- Ground-truth-based automated trajectory evaluations:
    - Exact match
    - In-order match
    - Any-order match
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - Single-tool use

### Evaluating the Final Response
- Does the agent achieve its goals?
- Define custom success criteria
- Autoraters (LLMs as judges): assess against criteria
- Precise evaluation criteria crucial without ground truth

### Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation
- Subjective judgment, creative problem-solving
- Calibrate automated evaluations
- Key benefits:
    - Subjectivity
    - Contextual understanding

- Task allocation: efficient division, feedback loops
- Coordinating reasoning: debate and reason together
- Managing context: tracking information between agents
- Time and cost: computationally expensive, user latency
- Complexity: increased system complexity

### Multi-Agent Evaluation

    - Cooperation and coordination
    - Planning and task assignment
    - Agent utilization
    - Scalability

## Agentic RAG: A Critical Evolution in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- Agentic RAG: autonomous retrieval agents refining search
- Enhancements:
    - Context-aware query expansion
    - Multi-step reasoning
    - Adaptive source selection
    - Validation and correction

### Agentic RAG and Its Importance
- Combines RAG strength with agent autonomy
- Agents orchestrate retrieval, evaluate information, make utilization decisions
- Advantages over traditional RAG:
    - Improved accuracy
    - Enhanced contextual understanding
    - Increased adaptability
- Valuable in complex, evolving domains

### Better Search, Better RAG
- Agents refine query, filtering, ranking, final answer
- Optimize search results (recall) before introducing agents
- Techniques to improve search:
    - Parse and chunk documents
    - Add metadata to chunks
    - Fine-tune embedding model/search adaptor
    - Faster vector database
    - Use a ranker
    - Implement check grounding
