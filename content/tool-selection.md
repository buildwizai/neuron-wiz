# Tool Selection
## Importance
- **Tool selection is crucial for an agent's success** and depends on the environment, the task, and the AI model powering the agent.
- The right tools enable an agent to **perceive its environment and act upon it** effectively.
## Considerations
### Task and Environment
- The tools needed are **highly dependent on the specific tasks** the agent is designed to perform and the environment it operates within.
### AI Model
- The capabilities and limitations of the AI model will also influence which tools are most appropriate.
## Challenges
### Balancing Capability and Complexity
- **More tools increase an agentâ€™s capabilities**, but can make it harder to use them efficiently.
- It's similar to how it is harder for humans to master a large set of tools.
### Context Limits
- Adding more tools also increases the length of tool descriptions, which may not fit within a model's context.
## Evaluation
### Experimentation and Analysis
- **Tool selection requires experimentation and careful analysis**, as there is no foolproof guide to selecting the best tools.
- Iterate through different combinations of tools to find what works best.
### Methods
- **Compare agent performance with different sets of tools** to evaluate the effectiveness of various combinations.
- **Conduct ablation studies** to measure how the agent's performance is impacted when a tool is removed from its inventory.
- **Identify tools that the agent frequently makes mistakes with**.
- **Analyze tool usage distributions** to see what tools are used most and least, and to identify any patterns in tool selection.
## Factors to Evaluate
### Performance
- Evaluate how well an agent performs given a specific set of tools.
### Tool Usage
- Examine how frequently each tool is used, identifying tools that may be underutilized.
### Error Patterns
- Look for tools that the agent consistently struggles with and consider changing or improving them.
## Tool Preference
### Task-Specific Preferences
- Different tasks often require different types of tools.
### Model-Specific Preferences
- Different models may have preferences for certain tools.
- This means that you may need to experiment with different tool sets when changing models.
## Tool Evolution
### Tool Combination
- Tools can be combined into more complex tools to improve efficiency and capability.
### Skill Acquisition
- Agents can learn new skills (tools) and store them for later use in a skill library.
### Tool Transition
- Study the likelihood of one tool being used after another to help identify tools that can be combined.
## Framework Considerations
### Framework Capabilities
- When evaluating a framework, consider what planners and tools it supports.
### Tool Extension
- Evaluate how easy it is to add new tools to the agent as needs change.
### Tool Focus
- Be aware that different frameworks may focus on different categories of tools.
