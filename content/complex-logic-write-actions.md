# Complex Logic and Write Actions
## Complex Logic
  - **Purpose:** Enables more intricate application flows with loops and conditional branching.
  - **Functionality:**
    - **Conditional Output Routing:** Model outputs are conditionally passed to other models or fed back as input to the same model.
    - **Iterative Processes:**  Model can plan and decide what to do next, often leading to multi-step tasks.
    - **Task Completion:** The system continues processing until a model determines the task is complete.
  - **Examples:**
    - Planning an itinerary with sub-tasks.
    - Tasks with multiple iterative steps.
    - Any task that requires a sequence of actions
  - **Implementation**
    - A response can be sent back to context construction
    - The model gateway is part of this iterative processing.
## Write Actions
  - **Purpose:** Allows the system to make changes to data sources and the real world.
  - **Functionality:**
    - Enables models to perform tasks beyond information retrieval.
    - The system can alter data sources based on model output.
  - **Examples:**
     - Sending emails, placing orders.
     - Updating values in a database.
  - **Benefits:**
    - Significantly increases system capabilities and automation.
  - **Risks:**
    -  Potential for misuse.
    -  Vulnerability to cyber attacks, including prompt injection.
    -  Unauthorized access to internal databases.
    -  Manipulation of the system to perform harmful actions.
  - **Security Considerations:**
    - System should be protected from bad actors.
    - Trust in the system's capabilities and security measures is critical.
  - **Prompt Injection:**
    - Manipulating input prompts to get undesirable behaviors.
    - Can be used to trick the system into revealing or corrupting private data.
  - **Important Note:** Giving AI write access requires careful consideration and robust security measures.
