# Comprehensive Security with AI

## 1. Core Concept

### AI in Security:

- AI will be widely adopted into security and privacy best practices by 2025.
- AI has the potential to become a powerful tool in every security professional’s toolkit.
- Helps to bolster security defenses, identify and combat threats, relieve manual work, and speed up responses.

## 2. AI Use Cases to Bolster Security

- Rule creation
- Attack simulation
- Compliance violation detection

## 3. Benefits of Using AI in Security

- Average reduction in breach costs when organizations apply security AI and automation: $2.2M.
- Bolsters security defenses against increasingly sophisticated threats.
- Ensures a safer and more resilient digital landscape for organizations worldwide.
- Speeds up responses.

## 4. Adoption and Novel Applications

### Growing Adoption:

- Many organizations are exploring ways to use AI.
- For example, demand for security solutions that fight disinformation is expected to take off.

### Companies Tighten Security:

- **Bayer** leverages Google Cloud to support the identification of security threats and sees value from high security standards.
- **Apex Fintech** has accelerated the creation of complex threat detections, reducing the time required from hours to mere seconds with Google Security Operations.
- **One New Zealand**, is working on infusing gen AI capabilities from within Google Security Operations to ultimately predict, prepare for, and address security risks faster.

## 5. The State of Security in 2025

- Organizations can’t afford complacency in the security space.
- Failing to secure against emerging threats is more costly than ever before.
- The global average cost of a data breach in 2024 is increasing 10% over the previous year to reach USD $4.88 million.
- Attackers are using AI to increase the volume and impact of attacks.
- Organizations urgently need to put AI-powered security tools to work.
