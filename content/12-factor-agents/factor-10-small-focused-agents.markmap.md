# 10. Small, Focused Agents
## Principle
- Build small agents that do one thing well
- Avoid monolithic, complex agents
## Reasoning
- LLMs lose focus as context grows
- Keep workflows 3-10 steps (max ~20)
## Benefits
- Manageable context
- Clear responsibilities
- Better reliability
- Easier testing and debugging
## What if LLMs get smarter?
- Small agents still useful for quality
- Expand agent scope as LLMs improve
- Grow agent boundaries intentionally
