# 2. Own Your Prompts
## Principle
- Don't outsource prompt engineering to frameworks
- Treat prompts as first-class code
## Framework Approach
- Black box agent/task setup
- Hard to tune or reverse engineer
## Custom Approach
- Write explicit prompt templates
- Use any tool or manual templating
## Benefits
- Full control
- Testing and evals
- Fast iteration
- Transparency
- Role hacking (advanced prompt usage)
## Reminder
- Prompts are the main interface to the LLM
- Flexibility to experiment is key
