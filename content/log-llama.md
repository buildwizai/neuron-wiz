# LogLLaMA: Transformer-based Log Anomaly Detection

- Introduction
  - Log anomaly detection: vital for monitoring, debugging, security
  - Anomalies indicate faults, breaches, failures
  - Accurate detection is essential

- Traditional Machine Learning Methods
  - PCA: separates repeating patterns
  - iForest: isolates anomalies with random trees
  - OCSVM: boundary around normal
  - LogCluster: density-based clustering
  - Limitation: hand-crafted features, cannot capture temporal info

- Deep Learning Methods
  - Treat logs as natural language
  - DeepLog (LSTM): models log event sequences
  - LogAnomaly: extends DeepLog, captures sequential and quantitative features
  - Higher accuracy, but LSTM struggles with long sequences

- Transformer-based LLMs for Logs
  - Inspired by NLP success
  - Log messages as natural language
  - BERT (LogBERT): predicts masked tokens, learns semantics/context
  - LogST: novel log semantics representation
  - PreLog: sequence-to-sequence transformer, contrastive learning
  - Benefit: self-attention, bidirectional context
  - Limitation: sensitivity to masking, max input length, may miss sequential/temporal relationships

- LogLLaMA Framework
  - Three Modules
    - Log message preprocessing
    - Model finetuning
    - Anomaly detection with RL

  - Module 1: Log Message Preprocessing
    - Input: raw log messages
    - Output: structured log representation
    - Raw log: variants (change) & invariants (static)
    - Drain algorithm: strips variants, templates with invariants (<*>)
    - Templates hashed to fixed-length log keys
    - Log key sequence forms input

  - Module 2: Model Finetuning
    - Log key sequences encoded, fed to LLaMA2
    - Finetuning on normal log sequences (BGL, Thunderbird, HDFS)
    - Learns normal patterns and structure
    - Predicts next log key
    - Loss: minimizes difference between predicted and true next key

  - Module 3: Anomaly Detection with RL
    - Uses REINFORCE algorithm, custom reward system
    - Sequential decision making, learns long-term strategy
    - Top-K selection: model outputs K candidate keys
      - True key in list: normal
      - Not in list: anomalous
    - Agent: LogLLaMA generates keys
    - State: current and previous context
    - Action: generate next keys (Top-K sampling)
    - Reward:
      - Top-K match: +1 if true key present
      - Top-K miss: +1 if anomaly, -1 if normal but missed
      - Entropy bonus: rewards exploration
      - Reward clipping for stability
    - K: hyperparameter, controls strictness and robustness
    - Policy: probability distribution over actions, updated with REINFORCE gradient

- Experiments
  - Datasets
    - BGL: 4.7M messages, 348k anomalous
    - Thunderbird: 20M messages, 758k anomalous
    - HDFS: 11.1M messages, 284k anomalous
  - Baselines
    - Traditional: PCA, iForest, OCSVM, LogCluster
    - Deep Learning: DeepLog, LogAnomaly, LogBERT
  - Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Implementation
    - Drain parser, log keys as tensors
    - LLaMA-2: 18 layers, 12 attention heads, 60-dim input
    - Top-K = 50% of training keys
    - Training: 10% normal logs, 100 epochs finetuning, 10 RL episodes

  - Results
    - LogLLaMA: highest F1 on all datasets, large margins
    - Understands normal patterns, captures anomalies
    - RL improves overall detection, especially on Thunderbird
    - Outperforms traditional and deep learning baselines
    - Ablation: RL component significantly boosts performance

- Conclusion
  - Log anomaly detection crucial for security
  - Transformer LLMs effective for log understanding
  - LogLLaMA: LLaMA-2 based, finetuned on normal logs
  - Reinforcement learning further improves detection
  - Proven effectiveness on BGL, Thunderbird, HDFS
  - Outperforms state-of-the-art methods
