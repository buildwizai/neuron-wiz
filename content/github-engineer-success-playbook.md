# GitHubâ€™s Engineering System Success Playbook (ESSP)
## Introduction
* Purpose: Drive meaningful, measurable improvements
* Inspiration: SPACE, DevEx, DX Core 4, DORA
* Core Idea: Quality, Velocity, Developer Happiness in unison drive business outcomes
* Systems Thinking Approach
* 12 Suggested Metrics
  * Downstream/Lagging indicators
  * Need Leading indicators
  * Need Companion metrics
  * Mapped to SPACE dimensions
* Key Concepts for Improvement
  * Team perspective
  * Select metrics with care (avoid gamification)
  * Balance measurement cost/benefits
  * Focus on improvements over time
  * Psychological safety
## Three Steps to Success
* Step 1: Identify Barriers
  * Goal: Understand obstacles, current state, desired future
  * Tasks
    * Audit processes & gather data (baselines, qualitative/quantitative)
    * Understand zone priorities
    * Conduct qualitative research (feedback, friction)
    * Prioritize metrics & barriers
  * Tips
    * Focus on root causes
    * Involve diverse roles
    * Balance quantitative & qualitative
    * Prioritize key areas
    * Ensure psychological safety
    * Compare teams for learning, not judgment
* Step 2: Evaluate Changes
  * Goal: Identify & agree on actionable changes
  * Tasks
    * Evaluate & prioritize solutions (cost, resources)
    * Risk, cost, benefit analysis (pilot, mitigation)
    * Engage stakeholders (review, buy-in, feedback)
  * Tips
    * Long-term sustainability
    * Consider trade-offs across zones
    * Involve team early
    * Define success metrics (leading/lagging)
    * Stay agile & iterative
    * High-impact, low-effort wins
* Step 3: Implement, Monitor, Adjust
  * Goal: Scale, track progress, make sustained improvements
  * Tasks
    * Implement changes (ownership, communication, training)
    * Monitor performance (metrics, qualitative feedback)
    * Adjust & iterate (analyze, pivot, continuous feedback)
  * Tips
    * Be patient, expect variance
    * Keep iterating
    * Watch for unintended consequences
    * Check psychological safety
    * Evaluate long-term impact
    * Use failures for learning
## Beyond the Steps
* Tailoring the ESSP
  * Align with team needs & workflows
  * Select relevant metrics
  * Choose measurement method (telemetry vs survey)
  * Complement lagging with leading indicators
  * Data across zones/SPACE dimensions
* Change Management
  * Essential for adoption & sustainability
  * Use frameworks (ADKAR, Kotter)
* Growth Mindset
  * Values learning over perfection
  * Embraces experimentation & failure
  * Fosters resilience
* Gamification
  * Done right: Aligns with intrinsic motivators, fosters positive culture
  * Pitfalls: Incentive misalignment, undesirable behaviors
## Alternatives to ESSP
* Focus on Feature Usage & Developer Feedback
* Business Value Engineering (Delay, Cost, Risk Reduction)
* Using SPACE as a Foundation
  * Holistic view (5 dimensions)
  * Avoids simplistic measures
## Appendix: Engineering Success Antipatterns
* Definition: Ineffective solutions with undesired consequences
* Examples (Description, Root Causes, Quality/Velocity Impact, AI Help, Non-AI Friction, Potential Metrics)
  * Big Bang Releases
  * Gold Plating / Overengineering / Technical Debt
  * Unclear Requirements
  * Manual Deployments
  * Testing Bottlenecks
  * Siloed Teams
  * Inconsistent Feedback Loops
  * Scope Creep
