# Improving AI Coding Agents with Task Management

## Problems with Basic AI Coding Agents
- Common issue: Errors and project disruption
- Lack of awareness of codebase dependencies

## Solution: Task Management Systems
- Helps understand overall implementation plan
- Controls context for each step

### Basic Implementation (Elle's example)
- Using a `task.md` file
- Prompting AI to break down tasks and add to `task.md`
- AI marks tasks as completed

### More Sophisticated Tools

#### Cloud Taskmaster (Taskmaster AI)
- Command-line package for Cursor and Windsurf
- Uses cloud models (3.7+) to parse PRDs
- Breaks down tasks logically, considers dependencies
- Key commands:
  - `taskmaster parse PRD`: Breaks down PRD into tasks
  - `taskmaster list`: Shows list of tasks and dependencies
  - `analyze complexity`: Evaluates task complexity using cloud and perplexity
  - `complexity report`: Shows complexity evaluation of each task
  - Expansion of complex tasks into smaller ones
  - `taskmaster update ID=... prompt=...`: Updates the plan
  - `taskmaster list with subtasks`: Shows all subtasks
- Integration with Cursor rules for self-improvement
- Uses entropy (for task breakdown) and perlastity (for research) API keys

#### Boomeran Task (Ru Code)
- Feature of Ru Code (open-source Cursor in VS Code)
- Allows custom agent modes:
  - Coding
  - Architect
  - Debug
  - Boomer wrench
- Boomer wrench mode: Focuses on planning and breaking down tasks
- Each subtask runs in its own context
- Architect agent: Plans project (user stories, features, structure, state management)
- Switches to code mode for implementation
- Built-in functionality for running and automated testing

## AI Coding Workflow with Task Management

### Using Boomeran Task
- Prompt boomer wrench mode to build an app
- Architect agent creates plan and breaks down tasks
- User provides feedback on the plan
- Switch to code mode for code generation based on the plan

### Using Cloud Taskmaster
- Installation: `npm install -g taskmaster-ai`
- Initialization: `taskmaster init`
- Create a PRD (manual or using tools like 10x coder.dev)
- Parse PRD: `taskmaster parse prd scripts/prd.txt`
- List tasks: `taskmaster list`
- Analyze complexity:
  - `taskmaster analyze complexity`
  - `taskmaster complexity report`
- Update tasks if needed: `taskmaster update ...`
- Implement with Cursor: Refer to the task list
- Task status tracking (in progress, done)
- Potential for automated execution ("yolo mode" with sufficient context)
- Iterative refinement and creation of new Cursor rules based on errors

## Benefits of Task Management
- Significantly reduces errors
- Improves code quality
- Enables building complex apps with less intervention
- Provides a structured coding approach

## Considerations for Building AI Agents for Business
- HubSpot research on successful use cases and ROI
- Distinguishing tasks for chatbots vs. autopilot agents
- Common pitfalls and best practices (e.g., integration)
