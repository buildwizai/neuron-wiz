# Development Environments

## What is a Development Environment
* Complete ecosystem for code
* Infrastructure
* Configuration settings
* Data
* Access controls
* Monitoring systems

## The Three Stages
* Development Environment (Dev)
  - Optimized for productivity
  - Local development
  - Simplified services
  - Test data
  - Frequent changes
  - Debugging tools enabled
  - Relaxed security
* Staging Environment
  - Mirror of production
  - Isolated environment
  - Sanitized data
  - Limited access
  - Testing and QA
  - External service integration
  - Performance testing
  - Security configuration
* Production Environment
  - Reliability and performance
  - Real user data
  - Controlled access
  - Comprehensive monitoring
  - Scalability
  - Backup and recovery
  - Full security
  - Cost optimization

## Purpose of Multiple Environments
* Risk Mitigation
* Contextual Optimization
* Cognitive Clarity
* Separation of Concerns
* Psychological Safety

## When to Use Each Environment
* Development Use Cases
* Staging Use Cases
* Production Use Cases

## Environment Flow
* Code Flow (Dev → Staging → Prod)
* Feedback Flow (Prod → Staging → Dev)
* Circular Learning System

## Environment Anti-Patterns
* "Works on My Machine" Syndrome
* Environment Drift
* Testing in Production
* Stale Staging
* Overproduction

## Cultivating Healthy Environments
* Documentation
* Automation
* Regular Synchronization
* Continuous Integration
* Transition Rituals
* Respecting Purpose

## Environment Transition Checklists
* Development to Staging
  - Code review
  - Test validation
  - Documentation
  - Deployment planning
  - Rollback strategy
* Staging to Production
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Performance analysis
  - Security validation
  - Monitoring setup
  - User communication
