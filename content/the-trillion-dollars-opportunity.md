## Packer Radio

### Framework for looking at AI market (Don Valentine question)

- **So what?** (Market size, comparison to Cloud)
    - Cloud transition vs AI transition
    - Cloud revenue ~ $400B
    - Global software market size
    - AI services market starting point order of magnitude bigger
        - Includes both services and software
    - Profit pools under attack
    - Progression: Tool -> Outcome -> Work
    - TAMs (Total Addressable Markets) are up for grabs
- **Why now?** (Imminent, not just inevitable)
    - Precedent conditions in place
        - Compute, Networks, Data, Distribution, Talent
    - Waves are additive
    - Opportunity is much bigger than prior waves
    - Coming much faster
    - Physics of distribution changed
        - Know about it, Want it, Can buy it
    - Cloud: needed gorilla marketing
    - AI (ChatGPT Nov 2022): Entire world paying attention
    - Distribution platforms (Reddit, Twitter) user base (1.2-1.8B)
    - Internet connectivity (5.6B people)
    - No barriers to adoption when starting gun went off
    - Rails in place
- **What now?** (How to play to win)
    - White space available
    - Value is at the application layer
        - Prior transition billion-plus revenue companies were mostly application layer
    - Competition from Foundation Models
        - Test time compute, reasoning, tool use, inter-agent communication
    - How startups can play
        - Go from customer back
        - Think vertical specific
        - Think function specific
        - Deal with complex problems (human in the loop)
    - Building a company in AI (95% same as normal)
        - Solve important problem uniquely
        - Get great people
    - AI-specific considerations (5%)
        - Leone merchandising cycle (Idea -> Product -> Built -> Marketed/Sold/Supported)
        - Value chain (Tech out vs Customer back)
    - Building Moats
        - Opinion/End-to-end solution for customer
        - Data flywheels (usage data)
        - Of the industry, for the industry (Open Evidence, Harvey)
        - Big bear hug around customers
    - What Sequoia looks for in AI companies (5% AI specific)
        - Revenue Vibe vs Durable Behavior Change
        - Inspect adoption, engagement, retention
        - Don't delude yourself
        - Good Vibes with Customers (Trust)
            - Trust more important than product now
            - Product gets better if they trust you
        - Margins
            - Current gross margin less important
            - COGS component decreasing (cost per token down 99%)
            - Price component increasing (selling outcome vs tool)
            - Path to healthy gross margins over time
        - Data Flywheel
            - Needs to tie to a business metric
        - Best moats
            - Nature hates a vacuum
            - Tremendous sucking sound in market for AI
        - Macroeconomics (tariffs, interest rates) don't matter
            - Rising tide of technology adoption swamps volatility
        - Run like heck business now
            - Go at maximum velocity

### What's happening with AI right now (Year in review)

- **Customer back**
    - Daily to Monthly Active User ratio
    - 2023: Terrible engagement, hype exceeded reality
    - Now: Changed dramatically
        - ChatGPT D/M ratio climbing, close to Reddit levels
        - Getting value out of AI, weaving into daily lives
        - Examples of value: advertising (ad copy), education (visualize concepts), healthcare (diagnosis - Open Evidence)
        - Scratching the surface
        - Models becoming more capable
- **Technology out**
    - Pre-training seems to be slowing down
        - Scaled 9-10 orders of magnitude
        - Low-hanging fruit picked
    - Research ecosystem finding new ways to break through
        - Reasoning (OpenAI, Noam Brown, Dan Roberts)
        - Synthetic data
        - Tool use
        - AIc scaffolding
        - Enthropic's MCP
        - Combining to create more capable AI
    - Meter benchmark (quantitative measure)
    - Qualitative (talking to people about what's possible now)
    - Innovation at blurry boundary of research and product
    - Deep Research
        - Notebook LM (Hu)

### Where value will occur

- **Application layer**
    - Debate with partners (Pat was right)
    - Companies creating customer back value (Harvey, Open Evidence)
    - Battleground intensifying
    - Foundation models competing here
- **Undisputed king of the stack: Jensen (Nvidia)**

### AI's killer apps

- **First cohort emerged**
    - ChatGPT, Harvey, Glean, Sierra, Cursor, A Bridge
- **New companies rising across diverse markets** (Listen Labs, Open Evidence)

### Agents

- Many new companies will be agent first
- Will evolve from prototypes to robust
- **Two paths to build robust agents**
    - Orchestration with rigorous testing/eval
    - Agents tuned on end-to-end tasks
- **Vertical agents (2025 prediction)**
    - Wonderful opportunity for founders with domain understanding
    - Trained end to end for specific workflow
    - Techniques: RL on synthetic/user data
    - Early evidence: outperform humans
    - Security: Expo (penetration testers)
    - DevOps: Traversal (troubleshooter)
    - Networking: Meter
    - Optimistic that vertical agents outperform best humans
- **Abundance era (2025 prediction)**
    - Code is first market category to tip
    - Preview of abundance era
    - Labor is cheap and plentiful
    - Taste becomes scarce asset
    - Coding agents as harbinger for other industries

### Predictions for mid and long term

- **Major next wave**
    - Agent Swarms (Machine Networks)
        - Began forming into businesses a year ago
        - Critical part of AI stack
        - Working with/against each other, collaborating, reasoning
    - Agent Economy (Maturing further)
        - Agents transfer resources, make transactions
        - Keep track, understand trust/reliability
        - Have their own economy
        - Humans work with agents, agents with humans

### Technology needed to achieve agent economy

- **Persistent Identity**
    - Agent itself persistent (personality, understanding)
    - Understanding the user (memory, consistency)
    - Challenges remain despite RAG, Vector DBs, long context windows
- **Seamless Communication Protocols**
    - Needed like TCP/IP for personal computing
    - Building the protocol layer now
    - Excitement around MCP
    - Allow transfer of information, value, trust
- **Security**
    - On the rise, top of mind
    - More important than in current economy
    - Cottage industry around trust and security

### What it means for each of us

- **Change in mindsets**
    - Stochastic mindset (Departure from determinism)
        - AI may not remember things exactly like computers
        - Materially different thinking
    - Management mindset
        - Understanding what agents can/can't do
        - Transition to complex managerial decisions (blocking processes, feedback)
        - Avoid year-end reviews of agents
- **More leverage with significantly less certainty**
    - Can do more but must manage uncertainty/risks
    - Room attendees well suited to thrive
- **Leverage chart prediction (from last year)**
    - Individual functions use agents
    - Functions cluster, processes completed by agents
    - First one-person unicorn predicted (hasn't happened yet)
    - Companies scale faster with fewer people
    - Highest level of leverage ever seen
- **Processes/Agents will merge**
    - Neural networks within larger networks
    - Network of neural networks
    - Will change everything
    - Reinvent individual work
    - Rewire companies
    - Recreate the economy
