# How AI is Reinventing Software Business Models

## Bret Taylor's Insights & Journey
- From Engineer to Entrepreneur/Leader
    - Overcoming Single-Issue Focus
    - Importance of Impact vs. Doing What's Comfortable
    - Self-Awareness and Changing What You Do
    - Don't Let What You're Good At Become Who You Are

## Sierra: Vision for AI Agents
- Hypothesis: AI Agent as Main Digital Interface
    - Every Company Needs a Singular Agent
    - Helping Companies Build Customer-Facing AI Agents (e.g., ADT, SiriusXM)
    - Agents as Expression of Brand and Business

## The AI Market Landscape
- Foundation Models
    - Capital Intensive, Consolidation Expected
    - Like Cloud Infrastructure: Few Players, Low Margin, High Scale
- Tools (Pickaxes in the Gold Rush)
    - Threatened by Foundation Model Companies
    - Challenging but Can Be High Scale
- Applied AI (Manifests as Agents)
    - The "New Software as a Service"
    - Exciting Time for Applied Applications

## Value Proposition of Applied AI/Agents
- How Software Should Be Consumed
- Changes Market Dynamics
- Selling Outcomes, Not Productivity
- Solving Valuable Business Problems
- Order of Magnitude Less Expensive than Current Costs
- Gigantic Total Addressable Market (Vertical/Domain Specific)
- Potential for Trillion-Dollar Enterprise Software Company

## Business Models for AI Agents
- Outcomes-Based Pricing (Sierra's Model)
    - Pay When Agent Resolves Issue Autonomously
    - Aligns with Customer Business Model
    - Evolution from Subscription (SaaS)
    - Like Paying a Sales Commission
- Disrupts Traditional Enterprise Software Model
    - Breaks Arms-Length Relationship
    - Requires Company Accountability
- Value from Cost Savings vs. Topline Growth
    - Interest in Both
    - Topline Outcomes Always More Valuable
    - Cost Savings Can Drive Reinvestment in Growth
    - Cost Savings Advantage May Be Temporary
- Understanding Customer Buying Cycle
    - Who is Buying? (e.g., HR vs. Marketing)
    - How Do They Buy? (e.g., Subscription vs. Usage, Prepay vs. On-Demand)
    - Who are Gatekeepers?

## Startups vs. Incumbents in the AI Era
- Startup Advantages
    - Not Encumbered by Old Business Models
    - Less Operational Scaffolding/Overhead Today
    - Can Focus on Core Differentiation
- Incumbent Challenges
    - Changing Business Models is Hard
    - Risk of Not Adapting (like Blockbuster vs. Walmart/Amazon)
    - Need to Lean into AI

## Strategies for Success

    - Applications are Specialized
    - Provides Value Quickly
    - Skepticism of Pure Play Horizontal Platforms for Enterprise
- Solve Acute Business Problems
- Show Up as a Partner
- Deep Customer Research and Understanding Needs
- Speak the Language of Your Customer
- Listen and Understand
- Reflect Value Through Customer Problems
- Tactical Excellence
- Focus on Making Customers Successful
- Avoid Spending Time/Resources on Non-Core Things
