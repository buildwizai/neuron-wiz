## üîç For Content Creators

Want to create your own mind maps with NeuronWiz? It's as simple as writing Markdown files:

```markdown
---
title: The Future of AI
description: Exploring emerging trends in artificial intelligence
tags: [AI, technology, future]
---

# The Future of AI

## Machine Learning Advancements
### Foundation Models
### Reinforcement Learning

## Ethical Considerations
### Bias Mitigation
### Safety Guidelines
```

Your Markdown file's structure automatically becomes the mind map's structure:
- Level 1 headings (`#`) become the central node
- Level 2 headings (`##`) become primary branches
- Level 3+ headings become deeper branches
