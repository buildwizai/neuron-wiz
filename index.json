Natural Language to Tool Calls\n* Convert user language to structured tool calls\n* Example: payment link creation\n* Deterministic code executes structured output\n\n### 2. Own Your Prompts\n* Don't rely on framework black boxes\n* Treat prompts as first-class code\n* Benefits: control, testing, iteration, transparency\n\n### 3. Own Your Context Window\n* Everything is context engineering\n* Structure context for LLM efficiency\n* Standard vs custom context formats\n* Benefits: information density, error handling, safety, flexibility, token efficiency\n\n### 4. Tools Are Just Structured Outputs\n* Tools = structured LLM output triggering code\n* LLM outputs JSON, code decides what to do\n* Clean separation of decision and execution\n\n### 5. Unify Execution State and Business State\n* Minimize separation between execution and business state\n* Infer execution state from context window\n* Benefits: simplicity, serialization, debugging, flexibility, recovery, forking, observability\n\n### 6. Launch/Pause/Resume with Simple APIs\n* Agents should be pausable and resumable\n* Simple APIs for launching, pausing, resuming\n* External triggers (webhooks) for resuming\n\n### 7. Contact Humans with Tool Calls\n* LLM can request human input as a tool call\n* Structured events for human interaction\n* Benefits: clear instructions, outer loop agents, multiple human access, multi-agent, durability\n\n### 8. Own Your Control Flow\n* Build custom control structures for your use case\n* Interrupt/resume agent flow as needed\n* Example: break loop for human input or long-running tasks\n* Benefits: resumability, review/approve before execution\n\n### 9. Compact Errors into Context Window\n* Add errors to context for self-healing\n* Limit retries, escalate to human if needed\n* Benefits: self-healing, durability\n\n### 10. Small, Focused Agents\n* Prefer small agents with clear responsibilities\n* Manageable context, better reliability, easier testing/debugging\n* Expand agent scope as LLMs improve\n\n### 11. Trigger from Anywhere\n* Allow agents to be triggered from any channel (slack, email, events)\n* Meet users where they are\n* Enable outer loop agents and high-stakes tools\n\n### 12. Make Your Agent a Stateless Reducer\n* Agents as stateless reducers (fold over events)\n* Simplicity and composability\n\n## Honorable Mention\n### 13. Pre-fetch All the Context You Might Need\n* Deterministically fetch likely-needed context before LLM asks\n* Reduces token round trips, improves efficiency\n\n## Recurring Themes\n* Flexibility: try everything, experiment with structure\n* Context Engineering: optimize what and how you pass to LLMs\n* Deterministic code + LLM reasoning: best of both worlds\n* Human-in-the-loop: for high-stakes or error recovery\n* Serialization and observability: easy to debug, resume, and audit\n"

SoftwareEngineering, 12Factor, Markmap]\nmarkmap:\n  colorFreezeLevel: 2\n  maxWidth: 700\n---\n# Building Robust AI Agents / 12 Factor Agents\n## The Problem with Traditional Agents (Loop until you solve it)\n* History: Software traditionally Directed Graphs (DGs), Acyclic Directed Graphs (DAGs); Agents seen as different, throwing DAG away\n* Loop: LLM determines next step (tool calling), deterministic code executes, result appended to context, repeat until done\n* Initial context is starting event (message, cron, etc.); LLM chooses tool or 'done'\n* Biggest Problem: Agents get lost when context window gets too long\n  * Spin out trying same broken approach\n  * Happens with agentic coding tools too\n  * Anything more than 10-20 turns becomes a big mess the LLM can't recover from\n  * Not reliable enough for production/customers\n## What Actually Works: Micro Agents\n* Taking agent pattern and sprinkling into broader mostly deterministic DAGs\n* Agents manage well-scoped sets of tasks\n* Allows incorporating live human feedback into workflow steps without context error loops\n* Example: Production deployment agent\n  * Deterministic code handles deployment steps, tests, approvals\n  * Agent's value is parsing human plaintext feedback for updated action\n  * Tasks and contexts are isolated\n  * LLM is kept focused on small, 5-10 step workflows\n## Factors for Building Robust Agents\n* Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls\n  * Convert natural language (e.g., \"create a payment link for $750\")\n  * To a structured object (e.g., JSON for an API call)\n  * Deterministic code picks up payload and executes\n* Factor 2: Own Your Prompts\n  * Don't outsource prompt engineering to frameworks\n  * Treat prompts as first-class code\n  * Benefits: Full Control, Testing and Evals, Iteration, Transparency, Role Hacking\n  * Prompts are primary interface with LLM\n* Factor 3: Own Your Context Window\n  * AI engineering is Context Engineering\n  * LLMs are stateless functions, need best inputs\n  * Context includes: prompts, instructions, RAG data, past state/history (calls, results, memory), structured output instructions\n  * Standard message-based format vs Custom optimized formats\n    * Experiment with different structures (e.g., XML-style)\n  * Benefits: Information Density, Error Handling, Safety, Flexibility, Token Efficiency\n  * Need flexibility to try everything for context\n* Factor 4: Tools Are Just Structured Outputs\n  * Tools are structured output (JSON) from LLM\n  * Pattern: LLM outputs JSON -> Deterministic code executes action -> Results fed back\n  * Separation: LLM decides what, code controls how\n  * Unlock flexibility by viewing \"tool calls\" as JSON describing code actions\n* Factor 5: Unify Execution State and Business State\n  * Avoid complex separation of state if possible\n  * Infer execution state from the context window (metadata about history)\n  * Minimize state outside context window\n  * Benefits: Simplicity, Serialization, Debugging, Flexibility, Recovery, Forking, Human Interfaces/Observability\n* Factor 6: Launch/Pause/Resume with Simple APIs\n  * Agents should have standard program lifecycle APIs\n  * Easy launch, query, resume, stop for users, apps, pipelines, agents\n  * Pause for long-running operations, resume via external triggers (webhooks)\n* Factor 7: Contact Humans With Tool Calls\n  * Use structured output/tools (e.g., `request_human_input`, `done_for_now`) for human interaction\n  * Receive human input/events via webhooks (slack, email, sms)\n  * Benefits: Clear Instructions, Enables Inner vs Outer Loop workflows (Agent->Human), Multiple Human Access, Multi-Agent capable, Durable (with Factor 6)\n  * Works great with Factor 11\n* Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow\n  * Build custom control structures for use case\n  * Interrupt/resume agent flow (e.g., for human input, long tasks, approvals)\n  * Need to interrupt between tool selection and invocation for review/approval of high-stakes calls\n  * Custom features: summarization, LLM-as-judge, context compaction, logging, rate limiting, durable pause\n* Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context Window\n  * Enables agent \"self-healing\"\n  * LLM reads error/stack trace to fix subsequent calls\n  * Can limit attempts per tool call\n  * Escalate to human after consecutive errors\n  * Benefits: Self-Healing, Durable\n  * Restructuring error representation or removing past events from context helps prevent spin-outs\n  * Best prevention is Factor 10 (small, focused agents)\n* Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents\n  * Build agents that do one thing well, not monolithic\n  * Agents are building blocks in deterministic system\n  * Keeps context windows manageable (3-10, max 20 steps)\n  * Benefits: Manageable Context, Clear Responsibilities, Better Reliability, Easier Testing/Debugging\n  * Allows gradual expansion of agent scope as LLMs improve context handling\n* Factor 11: Trigger From Anywhere, Meet Users Where They Are\n  * Enable triggering agents from various channels (slack, email, sms)\n  * Enable agents to respond via same channels\n  * Benefits: Meet users where they are (digital coworkers), Outer Loop Agents (triggered by events), High Stakes Tools possible with human loop\n* Factor 12: Make Your Agent a Stateless Reducer\n  * (Briefly mentioned as \"mostly just for fun\")\n* Factor 13: Pre-fetch all the context you might need\n  * If a tool is likely, fetch needed context beforehand\n  * Include context directly or via parameters/thread\n  * Saves token round trips\n  * AI engineering is all about Context Engineering"

Use it when complex reasoning or some cache memory is needed.\",\n  \"input_schema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"thought\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"A thought to think about.\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"thought\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Evaluation (τ-Bench)\n- Benchmark for realistic customer service scenarios\n- Evaluates:\n  - Navigating conversations with simulated users\n  - Following complex policy guidelines\n  - Using tools to access and manipulate database\n- Primary metric: **pass^k** (probability of all k trials successful)\n  - Measures consistency and reliability\n- Results in Airline Domain\n  - **\"Think\" + Optimized Prompt:** 0.570 (pass^1), 54% improvement over baseline\n  - Baseline: 0.370 (pass^1)\n  - \"Think\" alone improved performance over baseline\n  - Optimized prompt gave examples of reasoning approaches\n  - Examples of optimized prompt usage\n- Results in Retail Domain\n  - **\"Think\" alone:** 0.812 (pass^1), improved over baseline (0.783)\n  - Retail policy easier to navigate\n\n## Key Insights from τ-Bench Analysis\n- **Prompting matters significantly on difficult domains**\n- Easier domains may benefit from \"think\" alone\n- **Improved consistency across trials (pass^k)**\n\n## Performance Evaluation (SWE-Bench)\n- Similar \"think\" tool added\n- Improved performance by **1.6% on average**\n- Adapted \"think\" tool definition for coding/brainstorming\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"think\",\n  \"description\": \"Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed. For example, if you explore the repo and discover the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.

Shows shift from basic to complex system collaboration.\n\n- Recommendations for Developers/Researchers:\n  - Contextual Fit: Choose protocol based on scenario (MCP for tools, ANP for cross-domain Internet agents, A2A for enterprise collaboration)\n  - Focus on Security and Performance\n  - Monitor Protocol Evolution\n\n## Use-Case Analysis: Trip Planning\n\n- Comparative analysis of MCP, A2A, ANP, Agora\n- Scenario: Planning a five-day trip from Beijing to New York\n- Illustrates architectural differences and interaction patterns\n\n### MCP: Single Agent Invokes All Tools\n\n- Centralized approach, single agent coordinates all external service interactions\n- MCP Travel Client invokes Flight, Hotel, Weather Servers directly (get_flights(), get_hotels(), get_weather())\n- External services treated as tools, don't interact with each other\n- Information flow: star pattern with client at center\n- Client aggregates responses\n- Strengths: Simplicity, Control\n- Weaknesses: Lacks flexibility, high dependency, potential bottleneck\n\n### A2A: Complex Collaboration Inter-agents Within an Enterprise\n\n- Direct communication between different agents\n- Intelligence distributed across specialized agents (Transportation, Accommodation & Activities)\n- Agents have explicit dependencies (Flight, Activity depend on Weather)\n- Agents communicate directly, no central coordination for every interaction\n- A2A Travel Planner: non-central coordinator, collects final results\n- Strengths: Flexible, realistic architecture, reduces overhead, allows complex patterns across organizations\n\n### ANP: Cross-Domain Agent Protocol\n\n- Extends collaboration through standardized cross-domain interactions\n- Distinct organizational boundaries (Airline, Hotel, Weather Website)\n- Cross-domain collaboration via formal protocol-based requests/responses\n- Flight Agent negotiates with Weather Agent across domains\n- Travel Planner coordinates overall process, doesn't mediate every interaction\n- Strengths: Formalizes interaction between independent agents, suitable for distinct capabilities/interfaces/security boundaries\n\n### Agora: Natural Language to Protocol Generation\n\n- User-centric, converts natural language requests to standardized protocols\n- Distinctive layers:\n  - Natural language understanding (parse request)\n  - Protocol generation (transform components into formal protocols)\n  - Protocol distribution (dispatch to specialized agents - Flight, Hotel, Weather, Budget)\n  - Agents respond to specific protocol\n- Three-stage process (understanding, generation, distribution)\n- Strengths: Highly adaptable, shields specialized agents from NLP complexity, separation of concerns\n\n- Each protocol has specific conditions/dependencies:\n  - MCP: Centralized agent, sequential tool invocation, suitable for well-defined workflows\n  - A2A: Collaboration via message/data exchange between specialized agents, flexible communication patterns\n  - ANP: Structured protocol-based interactions, agent delegates execution steps, suitable for same or different domains\n  - Agora: Intermediary layer, translates natural language to specific protocols, maps user intentions\n\n- Applicability depends on: desired autonomy, communication flexibility, interface standardization, task complexity\n\n## Academic Outlook\n\n- Rapid development expected\n\n### Short-Term Outlook: From Static to Evolvable\n\n- Evaluation and Benchmarking: Unified benchmark beyond task success, incorporating efficiency, robustness, adaptability, scalability. Development of simulation environments/testbeds\n- Privacy-Preserving Protocols: Secure, confidential communication in sensitive domains. Minimize exposure of internal states/personal data. Managed access via authorization. Federated learning inspiration (sharing aggregated insights/anonymized results)\n- Agent Mesh Protocol: Communication model inspired by human group chats. Full transparency/shared history within agent group. Promotes coordination/collaboration. Requires mechanisms for group semantics, consistency, dynamic membership, overhead\n- Evolvable Protocols: Dynamic, modular, learnable components. Agents manage/refine protocols. Retrieve/combine modules, construct customized strategies. Discover optimal variations/negotiation strategies. Adaptability to novel situations, scale to complex scenarios\n\n### Mid-Term Outlook: From Rules to Ecosystems\n\n- Built-In Protocol Knowledge: Train LLMs with protocol content/structures integrated into parameters. Protocol-compliant behavior without explicit prompting. More efficient, seamless interaction. Limitation: adaptability to updates. Strategic importance for model providers\n- Layered Protocol Architectures: Separate concerns across levels (low-level transport vs. high-level semantics). Improve modularity/scalability across heterogeneous agents. Dynamic protocol composition. Integrate ethical, legal, social constraints at higher layers\n\n### Long-Term Outlook: From Protocols to Intelligence Infrastructure\n\n- Collective Intelligence and Scaling Laws: Emergence in large-scale, interconnected agent populations. Investigate how size, topology, protocols shape system behaviors, emergent properties, robustness. Observe/analyze dynamics at web scale. Inform principled design of distributed agent collectives\n- Agent Data Networks (ADN): Foundational data infrastructure optimized for agent communication/coordination. Structured, intent-driven, protocol-compliant exchange. Machine-centric data representations (latent task states, memory snapshots, context logs). Support agent operational needs (state sync, planning, asynchronous collaboration) without human intervention\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- First comprehensive analysis of existing agent protocols\n- Systematic two-dimensional classification\n- Evaluation of key dimensions (efficiency, scalability, security)\n- Practical reference for practitioners and researchers\n- Highlights trade-offs and design considerations\n- Future: evolvable, privacy-aware, group-coordinated protocols, layered architectures, collective intelligence infrastructures\n- Paves way for connected, collaborative agent ecosystem\n- Agents and tools form coalitions, exchange knowledge, co-evolve\n- Potential to unlock new era of distributed, collective intelligence\n"

Examples: GPT-3, GPT-4, PaLM, LLaMA\n    - Serve as \"brains\" for many AI agents\n- **AI Agents**\n    - Systems that perceive and act to achieve goals\n    - Use LLMs for language and reasoning\n    - Decision-making loop: observe, reason, act\n    - Frameworks: AutoGPT, BabyAGI, Generative Agents\n    - Challenges: grounding, constraints, proactive behavior\n- **Tools as Extensions of AI Agents**\n    - External systems invoked via API/function call\n    - Address knowledge gaps, enable real-time info/actions\n    - Examples: WebGPT, Toolformer, HuggingGPT, LangChain\n    - Motivates standardization of integrations\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**\n    - Open standard for connecting AI models/agents with external resources\n    - Client-server model, vendor-agnostic, inspired by LSP\n    - Decouples AI models from tools, enables plug-and-play components\n- **Multi–AI Agent Systems**\n    - Multiple agents collaborate for complex tasks\n    - Motivations: specialization, parallelism, emergent behavior\n    - Requires standards for communication and trust\n- **Multi AI Agent Collaboration**\n    - Proof-of-concept systems: CAMEL, AutoGen, Generative Agents\n    - Challenges: coordination, communication, misinforming\n    - Modern agents prefer lightweight formats (JSON, natural language)\n    - Coral Protocol extends MCP for agent-to-agent communication\n- **Agent Communication Languages**\n    - Early: KQML, FIPA ACL (formal semantics, interaction protocols)\n    - Limitations: complexity, lack of adoption, overhead\n    -

Optional Normalization (whitespace, accents)\n  - Tokenization (words/subwords to integer IDs)\n  - Embedding (token ID to vector via lookup)\n  - Positional Encoding (word order information)\n\n### Multi-head attention\n- Feed embeddings into multi-head attention module\n- Self-attention: focus on relevant parts, capture long-range dependencies\n- Understanding self-attention:\n  - Queries, Keys, Values (Q, K, V) via learned weight matrices\n    - Query: \"Which other words are relevant to me?\"\n    - Key: label for relevance\n    - Value: word content\n  - Calculating scores: dot product of query with all keys\n  - Normalization: divide by sqrt(key dimension), softmax to get attention weights\n  - Weighted values: value vectors multiplied by attention weights, summed for context-aware representation\n- Multi-head attention: multiple sets of Q, K, V weights in parallel (\"heads\")\n- Each head focuses on different aspects\n- Outputs concatenated and linearly transformed (richer representation)\n- Improves handling of complex patterns and long dependencies\n- Crucial for nuanced understanding (translation, summarization, QA)\n\n### Layer normalization and residual connections\n- Each transformer layer (multi-head attention + feedforward)\n- Layer normalization: normalize activations (reduce covariate shift, improve gradient flow, faster convergence, better performance)\n- Residual connections: propagate inputs to layer outputs (easier optimization, vanishing/exploding gradients)\n- Applied to multi-head attention and feedforward layer\n\n### Feedforward layer\n- After multi-head attention and 'Add and Norm'\n- Position-wise transformation (independent for each position)\n- Incorporates non-linearity and complexity\n- Typically two linear transformations with non-linear activation (ReLU/GELU)\n- Adds representational power\n- Followed by another 'Add and Norm' step (stability, effectiveness)\n\n### Encoder and decoder\n- Original transformer: encoder and decoder modules\n- Series of layers: multi-head self-attention, feed-forward, normalization, residual connections\n- Encoder: processes input to contextual representation (embeddings Z)\n- Decoder: generates output based on encoder context Z (token by token)\n  -

Input embedding and positional encoding\n  - Masked self-attention for next token prediction\n  - Simplifies architecture for some tasks\n\n### Training the transformer\n- Training: modifying model parameters (loss, backpropagation)\n- Inference: using model for prediction (fixed weights)\n- Focus on training process\n\n#### Data preparation\n- Cleaning: filtering, deduplication, normalization\n- Tokenization: convert to tokens (Byte-Pair Encoding, Unigram)\n- Vocabulary: set of unique tokens (model's \"language\")\n- Split into training and test datasets\n\n#### Training and loss function\n- Batches of input sequences from training data\n- Corresponding target sequence (self-derived in unsupervised pre-training)\n- Transformer generates predicted output\n- Loss function (cross-entropy) measures difference\n- Gradients calculated, optimizer updates parameters\n- Repeated until convergence or specified tokens\n- Training task formulation depends on architecture:\n  - Decoder-only: language modeling (predict next token)\n  - Encoder-only (BERT): corrupt input, reconstruct (e.g., masked language modeling)\n  - Encoder-decoder: sequence-to-sequence (translation, QA, summarization)\n    - Can also be unsupervised (e.g., predict remainder of Wikipedia article)\n- Context length: number of previous tokens model remembers\n  - Longer context: more complex relationships, better performance\n  -

If a plan is good it is executed.\n## Planning Components\n- Plan generation, plan validation, and plan execution.\n- Can be considered a **multi-agent system** with each component as an agent.\n- Intent classifiers are often used to help agents plan by understanding the task's intent.\n## Foundation Models as Planners\n### Challenges\n- There is debate about the ability of foundation models, especially autoregressive language models, to plan effectively.\n- **Planning is essentially a search problem**, which requires backtracking.\n### Abilities\n- Foundation models may be capable of predicting the outcome of actions, which is crucial for planning.\n- LLMs can be augmented with search tools and state tracking systems to help them plan.\n## Plan Generation\n### Methods\n- Prompt engineering can turn a model into a plan generator, such as using system prompts with examples of valid plans.\n- Plans can be a list of functions with parameters inferred by the agent.\n- Parameters can be hard to predict since they are extracted from previous tool outputs.\n### Hallucination\n- **Both the action sequences and parameters can be hallucinated.**\n### Tips\n- Improve planning with better system prompts, tool descriptions and function design.\n## Function Calling\n- Many model providers offer tool use through function calling.\n- The agent automatically generates what tools to use and their parameters based on the query.\n- API settings can specify if a tool is required, not used or is chosen automatically.\n## Planning Granularity\n### Levels\n- Plans can have different levels of granularity (e.g. high-level vs. detailed).\n### Tradeoffs\n- Detailed plans are harder to generate but easier to execute. Higher-level plans are easier to generate, but harder to execute.\n- Hierarchical planning can balance this tradeoff.\n## Plan Representation\n### Function Names\n- Plans can be generated using exact function names.\n- This can make them harder to reuse and less robust to changes.\n### Natural Language\n- Plans can be generated using more natural language to increase flexibility and robustness.\n- Natural language plans require a translator to turn them into executable commands.\n## Complex Plans\n### Control Flows\n- Plans can have different control flows, including:\n  - Sequential\n  - Parallel\n  - If statements\n  - For loops\n- AI models determine the control flows.\n- Non-sequential control flows are harder to generate.\n## Reflection and Error Correction\n### Importance\n- Reflection is crucial for an agent's success.\n### Use Cases\n- Evaluating the feasibility of the request\n- Evaluating a generated plan\n- Evaluating results of an execution step\n- Evaluating if a task has been accomplished\n### Mechanisms\n- Self-critique prompts.\n- Specialized scoring models.\n### Interleaving\n- Interleaving reasoning and action (ReAct) is a common approach.\n### Learning\n- Reflection allows agents to learn from their mistakes by generating new plans after failures.\n- Separating evaluation and self-reflection (Reflexion) can improve performance."

Guide to effective prompt engineering techniques for maximizing large language model performance across various applications.\nmarkmap:\n  colorFreezeLevel: 2\n  maxWidth: 300\n---\n# Prompt Engineering\n\n## Introduction\n- Definition: Input to LLM to predict output\n- Not limited to data scientists/ML engineers\n- Effective prompting can be complicated\n- Iterative process\n- Inadequate prompts lead to ambiguous/inaccurate responses\n- Focus on Gemini model within Vertex AI or API for configuration access\n- Discusses techniques, tips, best practices, challenges\n\n## Prompt engineering\n- LLM as a prediction engine: predicts next token based on training data\n- Setting up LLM to predict the right sequence of tokens\n- Designing high-quality prompts for accurate outputs\n- Involves tinkering, optimizing length, evaluating style and structure\n- Used for various understanding and generation tasks\n- Requires choosing a model and potential optimization per model\n\n## LLM output configuration\n- Controls LLM's output\n\n### Output length\n- Number of tokens to generate\n- More tokens: higher computation, energy, time, cost\n- Reducing length stops prediction, doesn't make output succinct\n- Important for techniques like ReAct\n\n### Sampling controls\n- Determine how predicted token probabilities are processed\n\n#### Temperature\n- Controls randomness\n- Lower: deterministic, good for expected responses\n- Higher: diverse, unexpected results\n- 0: greedy decoding, highest probability token\n- Close to max: more random\n- Very high: all tokens equally likely after top-K/P\n\n#### Top-K and top-P\n- Restrict next token to top predicted probabilities\n- Control randomness and diversity\n- Top-K: selects top K likely tokens\n  - Higher K: more creative/varied\n  - Lower K: more restrictive/factual\n  - 1: greedy decoding\n- Top-P (nucleus sampling): selects top tokens whose cumulative probability <= P\n  - Range: 0 (greedy) to 1 (all)\n- Experiment to choose best method\n\n### Putting it all together\n- Choice depends on application and desired outcome\n- Settings impact each other\n- Order of application: top-K/P then temperature (if all available)\n- If no temperature: random selection from top-K/P\n- Extreme settings can cancel out others\n- General starting points provided for different creativity levels\n- More freedom can lead to less relevant text\n\n## Prompting techniques\n- LLMs tuned to follow instructions, trained on large data\n- Clearer prompt text leads to better prediction\n- Specific techniques help get relevant results\n\n### General prompting / zero shot\n- Simplest type: task description and starting text\n- \"No examples\"\n- Example: movie review classification\n\n### One-shot & few-shot\n- Provide examples to help model understand\n- Useful for guiding output structure/pattern\n- One-shot: single example\n- Few-shot: multiple examples showing a pattern\n- Number of examples depends on task complexity, example quality, model capabilities\n- General rule: 3-5 examples\n- Examples should be relevant, diverse, high quality, well-written\n- Include edge cases for robust output\n- Example: parsing pizza orders to JSON\n\n### System, contextual and role prompting\n- Techniques to guide text generation, focusing on different aspects\n\n#### System prompting\n- Sets overall context and purpose\n- Defines 'big picture'\n- Can specify output format\n- Useful for specific requirements, safety, toxicity control\n- Example: movie review classification with uppercase label\n- Example: movie review classification returning JSON\n\n#### Role prompting\n- Assigns specific character/identity to the model\n- Helps generate responses consistent with the role\n- Examples: book editor, teacher, motivational speaker, travel guide\n- Defines tone, style, focused expertise\n- Example: travel guide suggesting places in Amsterdam\n- Example: travel guide in Manhattan with humorous style\n\n#### Contextual prompting\n- Provides specific details/background information relevant to the task\n- Helps understand nuances and tailor response\n- Leads to seamless and efficient interactions\n- Example: suggesting blog articles for retro games\n\n### Step-back prompting\n- Improve performance by first considering a general related question\n- Feeds the answer to a subsequent prompt for the specific task\n- Activates relevant background knowledge and reasoning\n- Encourages critical thinking and knowledge application\n- Can mitigate biases\n- Example: writing a video game storyline\n- Step-back question example\n- Final prompt with step-back answer as context\n\n### Chain of Thought (CoT)\n- Improves reasoning by generating intermediate steps\n- Combine with few-shot for complex tasks\n- Advantages: low-effort, effective, works with off-the-shelf LLMs, interpretability, improved robustness between LLM versions\n- Disadvantages: more output tokens, higher cost, longer time\n- Example: math problem without CoT shows flaws\n- Example: math problem with CoT showing step-by-step reasoning\n- Zero-shot CoT example\n- Single-shot CoT example\n- Useful for code generation, synthetic data creation, tasks solvable by 'talking through'\n\n### Self-consistency\n- Combines sampling and majority voting for diverse reasoning paths\n- Selects the most consistent answer\n- Improves accuracy and coherence\n- Gives pseudo-probability of answer correctness but high cost\n- Steps: generate diverse paths, extract answers, choose most common\n- Example: email classification (IMPORTANT/NOT IMPORTANT) with multiple attempts\n\n### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)\n- Generalizes CoT by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously\n- Well-suited for complex tasks requiring exploration\n- Maintains a tree of thoughts\n\n### ReAct (reason & act)\n- Combines natural language reasoning with external tools\n- Allows LLM to perform actions (e.g., search, code interpreter)\n- Mimics human reasoning and action\n- Works via thought-action loop\n- Example: finding number of children of Metallica band members using LangChain and VertexAI\n- Requires resending previous prompts/responses and proper setup\n\n### Automatic Prompt Engineering\n- Automating the process of writing prompts\n- Prompt model to generate more prompts\n- Evaluate and potentially alter good prompts\n- Repeat the process\n- Example: generating ways to order a band t-shirt\n- Steps: write generation prompt, evaluate candidates, select best\n\n### Code prompting\n- Gemini primarily focuses on text, including code prompts\n\n#### Prompts for writing code\n- Gemini can help write code in various languages\n- Can speed up development\n- Example: Bash script to rename files in a folder\n- Important to read and test generated code\n\n#### Prompts for explaining code\n- Gemini can help understand existing code\n- Example: explaining the Bash code for renaming files\n\n#### Prompts for translating code\n- LLMs can translate code between languages\n- Example: translating the Bash file renaming script to Python\n- Important to handle indenting properly for some languages like Python\n\n#### Prompts for debugging and reviewing code\n- LLMs can help identify and fix errors\n- Example: debugging a broken Python script for renaming files\n- Can also suggest improvements to the code\n\n## What about multimodal prompting?\n- Uses multiple input formats beyond text\n- Includes combinations of text, images, audio, code, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n- Tinkering is required to find the right prompt\n- Language Studio in Vertex AI is good for testing\n\n### Provide examples\n- Most important best practice (one-shot/few-shot)\n- Acts as a powerful teaching tool\n- Improves accuracy, style, and tone\n\n### Design with simplicity\n- Prompts should be concise, clear, easy to understand\n- Avoid complex language and unnecessary information\n- Use action verbs\n- Examples of before and after rewrite\n\n### Be specific about the output\n- Concise instructions might be insufficient\n- Specific details improve accuracy\n- Examples of good and bad prompt for blog post generation\n\n### Use Instructions over Constraints\n- Instructions: explicit guidance on format, style, content\n- Constraints: limitations or boundaries\n- Positive instructions often more effective than constraints\n- Instructions directly communicate desired outcome\n- Constraints can limit potential and clash\n- Use constraints for safety, strict format/style\n- Prioritize positive instructions\n- Examples of good and bad prompt for blog post with specific details\n\n### Control the max token length\n- Set in configuration or explicitly request in prompt\n- Example: explaining quantum physics in a tweet\n\n### Use variables in prompts\n- Reuse prompts and make them dynamic\n- Store and reference information in multiple prompts\n- Useful for application integration\n- Example: travel guide fact about a city using variable\n\n### Experiment with input formats and writing styles\n- Different models, configurations, formats, word choices yield different results\n- Experiment with style, word choice, prompt type\n- Example of prompting for Sega Dreamcast using question, statement, instruction\n\n### For few-shot prompting with classification tasks, mix up the classes\n- Order of examples generally doesn't matter, but mix classes for classification\n- Avoid overfitting to specific order\n- Learn key features of each class for better generalization\n- Start with 6 few-shot examples\n\n### Adapt to model updates\n- Stay informed about model changes and capabilities\n- Test newer versions and adjust prompts\n- Use tools like Vertex AI Studio to store, test, document\n\n### Experiment with output formats\n- For non-creative tasks, try structured formats like JSON/XML\n- Benefits of JSON: no manual creation, sorted order, forces structure, limits hallucinations\n- Example in few-shot prompting section\n\n### Experiment together with other prompt engineers\n- Variance in performance across different attempts\n\n### CoT Best practices\n- Put the answer after the reasoning\n- Be able to extract the final answer separately\n- Set temperature to 0\n\n### Document the various prompt attempts\n- Crucial for learning and revisiting\n- Outputs can differ across models, settings, versions\n- Small differences in formatting/word choice can occur\n- Recommend using a Google Sheet template\n- Track version, OK/NOT OK/SOMETIMES OK, feedback\n- If using Vertex AI Studio, save prompts and track hyperlinks\n- For RAG, capture specific aspects impacting content\n- Save prompts in separate files in codebase\n- Use automated tests and evaluation\n- Iterative process: craft, test, analyze, document, refine, experiment\n- Template for documenting prompts provided\n\n## Summary\n- Lists various prompting techniques discussed\n- Briefly mentions challenges and best practices\n\n## Endnotes\n- Provides links to referenced materials"

predictability needed for trust/regulation; LangGraph supports anywhere)\n  - High floor, low ceiling\n    - Low floor: beginner-friendly\n    - High floor: steep learning curve\n    - Low ceiling: limitations, quickly outgrow\n    - High ceiling: extensive capabilities\n    - Workflow frameworks: High ceiling, high floor\n    - Agent frameworks: Low floor, low ceiling\n    - LangGraph aims for low floor (abstractions) and high ceiling (low-level)\n### Declarative vs non-declarative\n- Endless debate\n- Non-declarative usually implies imperative\n- LangGraph is a blend (declarative structure, imperative code)\n- Supports other APIs besides declarative (functional, event-driven)\n- Comparison to Tensorflow/Pytorch is incorrect\n- Many frameworks (Agents SDK, CrewAI) are just abstractions, not orchestration frameworks\n### Agent Abstractions\n- Most frameworks contain abstractions (prompt, model, tools, parameters)\n- Danger: Make it hard to understand/control exact input to LLM (crucial for reliability)\n- Hard to change logic without modifying source code\n- Original LangChain had this issue\n- Value: Easier to get started\n- Not good enough for building reliable agents yet\n- Think like Keras (high-level on top of lower-level)\n- LangGraph builds abstractions on top of its lower-level framework\n### Multi Agent\n- Agentic systems often contain multiple agents\n- Key part: How they communicate\n- Hard part (context to LLMs) applies to communication\n- Communication methods: Handoffs (Agents SDK example)\n- Best way: Workflows (blend of workflows and agents)\n- Agentic systems are combinations, not just one type\n- Building blocks can be combined and customized\n## Common Questions\n### What is the value of a framework?\n- Agent abstractions (easy start, common build method) - downsides exist\n- Short term memory (multi-turn support, threads)\n- Long term memory (cross-thread memory/learning)\n- Human-in-the-loop (feedback, approval, editing)\n- Human-on-the-loop (inspect trajectory, time travel, rerun)\n- Streaming (tokens, node updates, events)\n- Debugging/observability (inspect steps, inputs/outputs) - LangSmith integration\n- Fault tolerance (durable workflows, retries)\n- Optimization (evaluation datasets, auto-optimize) - LangGraph not currently, dspy is example\n- Value props (except abstractions) benefit all agentic system types\n- Framework needed depends on required features and willingness to build them\n- Understand the underlying code\n### As models get better, will everything become agents instead of workflows?\n- Tool-calling agents will improve\n- Controlling LLM context still important\n- Simple tool calling loop enough for some apps\n- Workflows simpler/better for others\n- Most production systems will be combinations\n- Both OpenAI/Anthropic recommend simplest solution first\n- Simple tool calling loop likely only with models trained on specific data\n  - Task is unique (enterprise use cases) - often requires platforms for customization (Sierra) - training SOTA models is hard, currently mostly large labs\n  - Task is not unique (computer use, coding) - general models might be good enough (OpenAI Computer Use, coding agents) - sensitivity to training data shape matters\n- Even pure agent apps benefit from framework features (memory, human-in-loop, etc.)\n### What did OpenAI get wrong in their take?\n- Based on false dichotomies, conflates dimensions\n- Inflates value of singular abstraction\n- Misses main challenge (context control) and main framework value (reliable orchestration with control and production features)\n- Specific issues:\n  - \"Declarative vs non-declarative graphs\": misleading, Agents SDK is abstraction not imperative\n  - \"Cumbersome as workflows grow dynamic\": true for complex workflows vs agents, not declarative vs non-declarative; use workflows when appropriate\n  - \"Necessitating learning specialized DSLs\": Agents SDK has DSL (abstractions), obfuscates context more than LangGraph\n  - \"More flexible\" (about Agents SDK): False, LangGraph is more flexible\n  - \"Code-first\" (about Agents SDK): LangGraph uses more normal code\n  - \"Using familiar programming constructs\" (about Agents SDK): LangGraph uses more normal code\n  - \"Enabling more dynamic... orchestration\" (about non-declarative): related to workflows vs agents, not declarative vs non-declarative\n### Comparing Agent Frameworks\n- Dimensions: Orchestration or abstraction? Declarative or otherwise? Other features?\n- Spreadsheet comparison exists (includes Agents SDK, Google's ADK, LangChain, Crew AI, etc.)\n## Conclusion\n- Hard part: Making sure LLM has appropriate context at each step\n- Agentic systems are workflows, agents, and in between\n- Most frameworks are just agent abstractions\n- Abstractions ease start but obfuscate context control\n- Agentic systems benefit from helpful features\n- LangGraph is orchestration framework with agent abstractions on top"
