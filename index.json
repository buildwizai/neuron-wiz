SoftwareEngineering, 12Factor, Markmap]\nmarkmap:\n  colorFreezeLevel: 2\n  maxWidth: 700\n---\n# Building Robust AI Agents / 12 Factor Agents\n## The Problem with Traditional Agents (Loop until you solve it)\n* History: Software traditionally Directed Graphs (DGs), Acyclic Directed Graphs (DAGs); Agents seen as different, throwing DAG away\n* Loop: LLM determines next step (tool calling), deterministic code executes, result appended to context, repeat until done\n* Initial context is starting event (message, cron, etc.); LLM chooses tool or 'done'\n* Biggest Problem: Agents get lost when context window gets too long\n  * Spin out trying same broken approach\n  * Happens with agentic coding tools too\n  * Anything more than 10-20 turns becomes a big mess the LLM can't recover from\n  * Not reliable enough for production/customers\n## What Actually Works: Micro Agents\n* Taking agent pattern and sprinkling into broader mostly deterministic DAGs\n* Agents manage well-scoped sets of tasks\n* Allows incorporating live human feedback into workflow steps without context error loops\n* Example: Production deployment agent\n  * Deterministic code handles deployment steps, tests, approvals\n  * Agent's value is parsing human plaintext feedback for updated action\n  * Tasks and contexts are isolated\n  * LLM is kept focused on small, 5-10 step workflows\n## Factors for Building Robust Agents\n* Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls\n  * Convert natural language (e.g., \"create a payment link for $750\")\n  * To a structured object (e.g., JSON for an API call)\n  * Deterministic code picks up payload and executes\n* Factor 2: Own Your Prompts\n  * Don't outsource prompt engineering to frameworks\n  * Treat prompts as first-class code\n  * Benefits: Full Control, Testing and Evals, Iteration, Transparency, Role Hacking\n  * Prompts are primary interface with LLM\n* Factor 3: Own Your Context Window\n  * AI engineering is Context Engineering\n  * LLMs are stateless functions, need best inputs\n  * Context includes: prompts, instructions, RAG data, past state/history (calls, results, memory), structured output instructions\n  * Standard message-based format vs Custom optimized formats\n    * Experiment with different structures (e.g., XML-style)\n  * Benefits: Information Density, Error Handling, Safety, Flexibility, Token Efficiency\n  * Need flexibility to try everything for context\n* Factor 4: Tools Are Just Structured Outputs\n  * Tools are structured output (JSON) from LLM\n  * Pattern: LLM outputs JSON -> Deterministic code executes action -> Results fed back\n  * Separation: LLM decides what, code controls how\n  * Unlock flexibility by viewing \"tool calls\" as JSON describing code actions\n* Factor 5: Unify Execution State and Business State\n  * Avoid complex separation of state if possible\n  * Infer execution state from the context window (metadata about history)\n  * Minimize state outside context window\n  * Benefits: Simplicity, Serialization, Debugging, Flexibility, Recovery, Forking, Human Interfaces/Observability\n* Factor 6: Launch/Pause/Resume with Simple APIs\n  * Agents should have standard program lifecycle APIs\n  * Easy launch, query, resume, stop for users, apps, pipelines, agents\n  * Pause for long-running operations, resume via external triggers (webhooks)\n* Factor 7: Contact Humans With Tool Calls\n  * Use structured output/tools (e.g., `request_human_input`, `done_for_now`) for human interaction\n  * Receive human input/events via webhooks (slack, email, sms)\n  * Benefits: Clear Instructions, Enables Inner vs Outer Loop workflows (Agent->Human), Multiple Human Access, Multi-Agent capable, Durable (with Factor 6)\n  * Works great with Factor 11\n* Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow\n  * Build custom control structures for use case\n  * Interrupt/resume agent flow (e.g., for human input, long tasks, approvals)\n  * Need to interrupt between tool selection and invocation for review/approval of high-stakes calls\n  * Custom features: summarization, LLM-as-judge, context compaction, logging, rate limiting, durable pause\n* Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context Window\n  * Enables agent \"self-healing\"\n  * LLM reads error/stack trace to fix subsequent calls\n  * Can limit attempts per tool call\n  * Escalate to human after consecutive errors\n  * Benefits: Self-Healing, Durable\n  * Restructuring error representation or removing past events from context helps prevent spin-outs\n  * Best prevention is Factor 10 (small, focused agents)\n* Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents\n  * Build agents that do one thing well, not monolithic\n  * Agents are building blocks in deterministic system\n  * Keeps context windows manageable (3-10, max 20 steps)\n  * Benefits: Manageable Context, Clear Responsibilities, Better Reliability, Easier Testing/Debugging\n  * Allows gradual expansion of agent scope as LLMs improve context handling\n* Factor 11: Trigger From Anywhere, Meet Users Where They Are\n  * Enable triggering agents from various channels (slack, email, sms)\n  * Enable agents to respond via same channels\n  * Benefits: Meet users where they are (digital coworkers), Outer Loop Agents (triggered by events), High Stakes Tools possible with human loop\n* Factor 12: Make Your Agent a Stateless Reducer\n  * (Briefly mentioned as \"mostly just for fun\")\n* Factor 13: Pre-fetch all the context you might need\n  * If a tool is likely, fetch needed context beforehand\n  * Include context directly or via parameters/thread\n  * Saves token round trips\n  * AI engineering is all about Context Engineering"

Numerical representations of real-world data (text, speech, image, video).\n    - Low-dimensional vectors where geometric distances reflect relationships.\n    - Compact representations preserving semantic meaning.\n    - Useful for retrieval and recommendations:\n        - Includes precomputing embeddings, mapping query embeddings, and efficient nearest neighbor retrieval.\n    - Essential for multimodality:\n        - Projects diverse formats into a common vector space and retains key characteristics.\n    - Task-specific representations.\n\n- **Types of Embeddings**\n    - Aim for low-dimensional representations that preserve essential information.\n    - **Text Embeddings**\n        - For natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text generation, classification, and sentiment analysis.\n        - *Token/Word Embeddings*\n            - Process: Tokenization, assigning unique integer IDs, and representing as sparse or dense vectors.\n            - Techniques include GloVe (global and local statistics), SWIVEL (local windows with negative sampling), Word2Vec:\n                - CBOW (predict middle word from context).\n                - Skip-gram (predict surrounding words from middle word).\n            - Can be derived from hidden layers of context-aware language models.\n        - *Document Embeddings*\n            - Represents meaning of words in paragraphs or documents.\n            - Applications include semantic search, topic discovery, classification, and clustering.\n            - Evolution from shallow models like Bag-of-Words, LSA, LDA, TF-IDF, and BM25 to deeper pretrained models like BERT and its variants (Sentence-BERT, SimCSE, E5) and other LLMs (T5, PaLM, Gemini, GPT, Llama).\n            - Involves options like single-vector and multi-vector approaches.\n\n    - **Image & Multimodal Embeddings**\n        - Unimodal image embeddings typically use CNNs or the penultimate layer from Vision Transformers.\n        - Multimodal embeddings combine text and image data.\n\n    - **Structured Data Embeddings**\n        - Created specifically for structured applications.\n        - General structured data may use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) for tasks like anomaly detection.\n        - User/item structured data often combines with unstructured embeddings for recommendations.\n\n    - **Graph Embeddings**\n        - Represents nodes and their relationships for tasks such as node classification, graph classification, link prediction, and recommendations.\n        - Techniques include DeepWalk, Node2vec, LINE, and GraphSAGE.\n\n- **Training Embeddings**\n    - Often uses a dual encoder (two-tower) architecture for queries/documents or image/text pairs.\n    - Employs contrastive loss to bring positive pairs closer and push negatives apart.\n    - Involves pretraining (unsupervised) followed by fine-tuning (supervised).\n    - Can initialize from large pretrained models (BERT, T5, GPT).\n    - Fine-tuning may include human labeling, synthetic data, distillation, and use of hard negatives.\n    - Sometimes adds extra layers for specific downstream tasks.\n\n## Vector Search\n\n- Moves beyond keyword matching to search for meaning.\n- **Process:**\n    - Compute embeddings for items.\n    - Store embeddings in a database.\n    - Embed incoming queries.\n    - Retrieve nearest neighbors using similarity metrics such as Euclidean, Cosine, or Dot product.\n\n- **Key Algorithms:**\n    - Linear search (O(N)) for small datasets.\n    - Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, which balances speed and accuracy:\n        - Techniques include quantization, hashing, clustering, and tree-based methods.\n    - Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) maps similar items into the same bucket.\n    - Tree structures like Kd-tree and Ball-tree use medians or radial distances for decision boundaries.\n    - Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) offer sub-linear (O(log n)) runtime.\n    - Google's ScaNN uses partitioning, approximate scoring, and optional rescoring.\n\n## Vector Databases\n\n- Designed for managing embeddings in production environments.\n- **Workflow:**\n    - Embed data points.\n    - Augment with metadata and index.\n    - Process queries by embedding inputs and retrieving similar items.\n    - May include caching and pre/post-filtering.\n\n- **Examples:**\n    - Managed solutions: Google Cloud's Vertex Vector Search, AlloyDB, Cloud SQL Postgres with pgvector.\n    - Open source options: Weaviate, ChromaDB.\n\n- **Operational Considerations:**\n    - Scalability (horizontal/vertical), availability, consistency.\n    - Real-time updates, backups, access control, and compliance.\n    - Handling updates due to model retraining and balancing update frequency vs. cost.\n    - Integrating with full-text search for factors like literal/syntactic data.\n\n## Applications\n\n- Retrieval tasks (question answering, recommendations).\n- Semantic text similarity for paraphrasing and duplicate detection.\n- Classification (binary, multi-class, multi-label).\n- Clustering and reranking.\n- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs:\n    - Retrieves relevant documents.\n    - Uses prompt expansion to generate more accurate responses.\n    - May supply sources for verification.\n\n## Summary\n- Embeddings and vector stores are crucial for managing and retrieving multimodal data.\n- Choosing the right embedding model and vector database is key.\n- Operational efficiency comes from automation and careful adjustment of resources.\n- Key takeaways include wisely selecting models and databases to support applications like search, recommendations, and RAG.\n"

Optional Normalization (whitespace, accents)\n  - Tokenization (words/subwords to integer IDs)\n  - Embedding (token ID to vector via lookup)\n  - Positional Encoding (word order information)\n\n### Multi-head attention\n- Feed embeddings into multi-head attention module\n- Self-attention: focus on relevant parts, capture long-range dependencies\n- Understanding self-attention:\n  - Queries, Keys, Values (Q, K, V) via learned weight matrices\n    - Query: \"Which other words are relevant to me?\"\n    - Key: label for relevance\n    - Value: word content\n  - Calculating scores: dot product of query with all keys\n  - Normalization: divide by sqrt(key dimension), softmax to get attention weights\n  - Weighted values: value vectors multiplied by attention weights, summed for context-aware representation\n- Multi-head attention: multiple sets of Q, K, V weights in parallel (\"heads\")\n- Each head focuses on different aspects\n- Outputs concatenated and linearly transformed (richer representation)\n- Improves handling of complex patterns and long dependencies\n- Crucial for nuanced understanding (translation, summarization, QA)\n\n### Layer normalization and residual connections\n- Each transformer layer (multi-head attention + feedforward)\n- Layer normalization: normalize activations (reduce covariate shift, improve gradient flow, faster convergence, better performance)\n- Residual connections: propagate inputs to layer outputs (easier optimization, vanishing/exploding gradients)\n- Applied to multi-head attention and feedforward layer\n\n### Feedforward layer\n- After multi-head attention and 'Add and Norm'\n- Position-wise transformation (independent for each position)\n- Incorporates non-linearity and complexity\n- Typically two linear transformations with non-linear activation (ReLU/GELU)\n- Adds representational power\n- Followed by another 'Add and Norm' step (stability, effectiveness)\n\n### Encoder and decoder\n- Original transformer: encoder and decoder modules\n- Series of layers: multi-head self-attention, feed-forward, normalization, residual connections\n- Encoder: processes input to contextual representation (embeddings Z)\n- Decoder: generates output based on encoder context Z (token by token)\n  - Masked self-attention: attends to earlier positions only (auto-regressive)\n  - Encoder-decoder cross-attention: focuses on relevant input parts (using encoder embeddings)\n  - Iterative process until end-of-sequence token\n- Majority of recent LLMs: decoder-only variant\n  - Input embedding and positional encoding\n  - Masked self-attention for next token prediction\n  - Simplifies architecture for some tasks\n\n### Training the transformer\n- Training: modifying model parameters (loss, backpropagation)\n- Inference: using model for prediction (fixed weights)\n- Focus on training process\n\n#### Data preparation\n- Cleaning: filtering, deduplication, normalization\n- Tokenization: convert to tokens (Byte-Pair Encoding, Unigram)\n- Vocabulary: set of unique tokens (model's \"language\")\n- Split into training and test datasets\n\n#### Training and loss function\n- Batches of input sequences from training data\n- Corresponding target sequence (self-derived in unsupervised pre-training)\n- Transformer generates predicted output\n- Loss function (cross-entropy) measures difference\n- Gradients calculated, optimizer updates parameters\n- Repeated until convergence or specified tokens\n- Training task formulation depends on architecture:\n  - Decoder-only: language modeling (predict next token)\n  - Encoder-only (BERT): corrupt input, reconstruct (e.g., masked language modeling)\n  - Encoder-decoder: sequence-to-sequence (translation, QA, summarization)\n    - Can also be unsupervised (e.g., predict remainder of Wikipedia article)\n- Context length: number of previous tokens model remembers\n  - Longer context: more complex relationships, better performance\n  - Longer context: more resources, slower training/inference\n  - Balance trade-offs based on task and resources\n"

If a plan is good it is executed.\n## Planning Components\n- Plan generation, plan validation, and plan execution.\n- Can be considered a **multi-agent system** with each component as an agent.\n- Intent classifiers are often used to help agents plan by understanding the task's intent.\n## Foundation Models as Planners\n### Challenges\n- There is debate about the ability of foundation models, especially autoregressive language models, to plan effectively.\n- **Planning is essentially a search problem**, which requires backtracking.\n### Abilities\n- Foundation models may be capable of predicting the outcome of actions, which is crucial for planning.\n- LLMs can be augmented with search tools and state tracking systems to help them plan.\n## Plan Generation\n### Methods\n- Prompt engineering can turn a model into a plan generator, such as using system prompts with examples of valid plans.\n- Plans can be a list of functions with parameters inferred by the agent.\n- Parameters can be hard to predict since they are extracted from previous tool outputs.\n### Hallucination\n- **Both the action sequences and parameters can be hallucinated.**\n### Tips\n- Improve planning with better system prompts, tool descriptions and function design.\n## Function Calling\n- Many model providers offer tool use through function calling.\n- The agent automatically generates what tools to use and their parameters based on the query.\n- API settings can specify if a tool is required, not used or is chosen automatically.\n## Planning Granularity\n### Levels\n- Plans can have different levels of granularity (e.g. high-level vs. detailed).\n### Tradeoffs\n- Detailed plans are harder to generate but easier to execute. Higher-level plans are easier to generate, but harder to execute.\n- Hierarchical planning can balance this tradeoff.\n## Plan Representation\n### Function Names\n- Plans can be generated using exact function names.\n- This can make them harder to reuse and less robust to changes.\n### Natural Language\n- Plans can be generated using more natural language to increase flexibility and robustness.\n- Natural language plans require a translator to turn them into executable commands.\n## Complex Plans\n### Control Flows\n- Plans can have different control flows, including:\n  - Sequential\n  - Parallel\n  - If statements\n  - For loops\n- AI models determine the control flows.\n- Non-sequential control flows are harder to generate.\n## Reflection and Error Correction\n### Importance\n- Reflection is crucial for an agent's success.\n### Use Cases\n- Evaluating the feasibility of the request\n- Evaluating a generated plan\n- Evaluating results of an execution step\n- Evaluating if a task has been accomplished\n### Mechanisms\n- Self-critique prompts.\n- Specialized scoring models.\n### Interleaving\n- Interleaving reasoning and action (ReAct) is a common approach.\n### Learning\n- Reflection allows agents to learn from their mistakes by generating new plans after failures.\n- Separating evaluation and self-reflection (Reflexion) can improve performance."

Engineering\n\n## Introduction\n- Definition: Input to LLM to predict output\n- Not limited to data scientists/ML engineers\n- Effective prompting can be complicated\n- Iterative process\n- Inadequate prompts lead to ambiguous/inaccurate responses\n- Focus on Gemini model within Vertex AI or API for configuration access\n- Discusses techniques, tips, best practices, challenges\n\n## Prompt engineering\n- LLM as a prediction engine: predicts next token based on training data\n- Setting up LLM to predict the right sequence of tokens\n- Designing high-quality prompts for accurate outputs\n- Involves tinkering, optimizing length, evaluating style and structure\n- Used for various understanding and generation tasks\n- Requires choosing a model and potential optimization per model\n\n## LLM output configuration\n- Controls LLM's output\n\n### Output length\n- Number of tokens to generate\n- More tokens: higher computation, energy, time, cost\n- Reducing length stops prediction, doesn't make output succinct\n- Important for techniques like ReAct\n\n### Sampling controls\n- Determine how predicted token probabilities are processed\n\n#### Temperature\n- Controls randomness\n- Lower: deterministic, good for expected responses\n- Higher: diverse, unexpected results\n- 0: greedy decoding, highest probability token\n- Close to max: more random\n- Very high: all tokens equally likely after top-K/P\n\n#### Top-K and top-P\n- Restrict next token to top predicted probabilities\n- Control randomness and diversity\n- Top-K: selects top K likely tokens\n  - Higher K: more creative/varied\n  - Lower K: more restrictive/factual\n  - 1: greedy decoding\n- Top-P (nucleus sampling): selects top tokens whose cumulative probability <= P\n  - Range: 0 (greedy) to 1 (all)\n- Experiment to choose best method\n\n### Putting it all together\n- Choice depends on application and desired outcome\n- Settings impact each other\n- Order of application: top-K/P then temperature (if all available)\n- If no temperature: random selection from top-K/P\n- Extreme settings can cancel out others\n- General starting points provided for different creativity levels\n- More freedom can lead to less relevant text\n\n## Prompting techniques\n- LLMs tuned to follow instructions, trained on large data\n- Clearer prompt text leads to better prediction\n- Specific techniques help get relevant results\n\n### General prompting / zero shot\n- Simplest type: task description and starting text\n- \"No examples\"\n- Example: movie review classification\n\n### One-shot & few-shot\n- Provide examples to help model understand\n- Useful for guiding output structure/pattern\n- One-shot: single example\n- Few-shot: multiple examples showing a pattern\n- Number of examples depends on task complexity, example quality, model capabilities\n- General rule: 3-5 examples\n- Examples should be relevant, diverse, high quality, well-written\n- Include edge cases for robust output\n- Example: parsing pizza orders to JSON\n\n### System, contextual and role prompting\n- Techniques to guide text generation, focusing on different aspects\n\n#### System prompting\n- Sets overall context and purpose\n- Defines 'big picture'\n- Can specify output format\n- Useful for specific requirements, safety, toxicity control\n- Example: movie review classification with uppercase label\n- Example: movie review classification returning JSON\n\n#### Role prompting\n- Assigns specific character/identity to the model\n- Helps generate responses consistent with the role\n- Examples: book editor, teacher, motivational speaker, travel guide\n- Defines tone, style, focused expertise\n- Example: travel guide suggesting places in Amsterdam\n- Example: travel guide in Manhattan with humorous style\n\n#### Contextual prompting\n- Provides specific details/background information relevant to the task\n- Helps understand nuances and tailor response\n- Leads to seamless and efficient interactions\n- Example: suggesting blog articles for retro games\n\n### Step-back prompting\n- Improve performance by first considering a general related question\n- Feeds the answer to a subsequent prompt for the specific task\n- Activates relevant background knowledge and reasoning\n- Encourages critical thinking and knowledge application\n- Can mitigate biases\n- Example: writing a video game storyline\n- Step-back question example\n- Final prompt with step-back answer as context\n\n### Chain of Thought (CoT)\n- Improves reasoning by generating intermediate steps\n- Combine with few-shot for complex tasks\n- Advantages: low-effort, effective, works with off-the-shelf LLMs, interpretability, improved robustness between LLM versions\n- Disadvantages: more output tokens, higher cost, longer time\n- Example: math problem without CoT shows flaws\n- Example: math problem with CoT showing step-by-step reasoning\n- Zero-shot CoT example\n- Single-shot CoT example\n- Useful for code generation, synthetic data creation, tasks solvable by 'talking through'\n\n### Self-consistency\n- Combines sampling and majority voting for diverse reasoning paths\n- Selects the most consistent answer\n- Improves accuracy and coherence\n- Gives pseudo-probability of answer correctness but high cost\n- Steps: generate diverse paths, extract answers, choose most common\n- Example: email classification (IMPORTANT/NOT IMPORTANT) with multiple attempts\n\n### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)\n- Generalizes CoT by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously\n- Well-suited for complex tasks requiring exploration\n- Maintains a tree of thoughts\n\n### ReAct (reason & act)\n- Combines natural language reasoning with external tools\n- Allows LLM to perform actions (e.g., search, code interpreter)\n- Mimics human reasoning and action\n- Works via thought-action loop\n- Example: finding number of children of Metallica band members using LangChain and VertexAI\n- Requires resending previous prompts/responses and proper setup\n\n### Automatic Prompt Engineering\n- Automating the process of writing prompts\n- Prompt model to generate more prompts\n- Evaluate and potentially alter good prompts\n- Repeat the process\n- Example: generating ways to order a band t-shirt\n- Steps: write generation prompt, evaluate candidates, select best\n\n### Code prompting\n- Gemini primarily focuses on text, including code prompts\n\n#### Prompts for writing code\n- Gemini can help write code in various languages\n- Can speed up development\n- Example: Bash script to rename files in a folder\n- Important to read and test generated code\n\n#### Prompts for explaining code\n- Gemini can help understand existing code\n- Example: explaining the Bash code for renaming files\n\n#### Prompts for translating code\n- LLMs can translate code between languages\n- Example: translating the Bash file renaming script to Python\n- Important to handle indenting properly for some languages like Python\n\n#### Prompts for debugging and reviewing code\n- LLMs can help identify and fix errors\n- Example: debugging a broken Python script for renaming files\n- Can also suggest improvements to the code\n\n## What about multimodal prompting?\n- Uses multiple input formats beyond text\n- Includes combinations of text, images, audio, code, etc.\n\n## Best Practices\n- Tinkering is required to find the right prompt\n- Language Studio in Vertex AI is good for testing\n\n### Provide examples\n- Most important best practice (one-shot/few-shot)\n- Acts as a powerful teaching tool\n- Improves accuracy, style, and tone\n\n### Design with simplicity\n- Prompts should be concise, clear, easy to understand\n- Avoid complex language and unnecessary information\n- Use action verbs\n- Examples of before and after rewrite\n\n### Be specific about the output\n- Concise instructions might be insufficient\n- Specific details improve accuracy\n- Examples of good and bad prompt for blog post generation\n\n### Use Instructions over Constraints\n- Instructions: explicit guidance on format, style, content\n- Constraints: limitations or boundaries\n- Positive instructions often more effective than constraints\n- Instructions directly communicate desired outcome\n- Constraints can limit potential and clash\n- Use constraints for safety, strict format/style\n- Prioritize positive instructions\n- Examples of good and bad prompt for blog post with specific details\n\n### Control the max token length\n- Set in configuration or explicitly request in prompt\n- Example: explaining quantum physics in a tweet\n\n### Use variables in prompts\n- Reuse prompts and make them dynamic\n- Store and reference information in multiple prompts\n- Useful for application integration\n- Example: travel guide fact about a city using variable\n\n### Experiment with input formats and writing styles\n- Different models, configurations, formats, word choices yield different results\n- Experiment with style, word choice, prompt type\n- Example of prompting for Sega Dreamcast using question, statement, instruction\n\n### For few-shot prompting with classification tasks, mix up the classes\n- Order of examples generally doesn't matter, but mix classes for classification\n- Avoid overfitting to specific order\n- Learn key features of each class for better generalization\n- Start with 6 few-shot examples\n\n### Adapt to model updates\n- Stay informed about model changes and capabilities\n- Test newer versions and adjust prompts\n- Use tools like Vertex AI Studio to store, test, document\n\n### Experiment with output formats\n- For non-creative tasks, try structured formats like JSON/XML\n- Benefits of JSON: no manual creation, sorted order, forces structure, limits hallucinations\n- Example in few-shot prompting section\n\n### Experiment together with other prompt engineers\n- Variance in performance across different attempts\n\n### CoT Best practices\n- Put the answer after the reasoning\n- Be able to extract the final answer separately\n- Set temperature to 0\n\n### Document the various prompt attempts\n- Crucial for learning and revisiting\n- Outputs can differ across models, settings, versions\n- Small differences in formatting/word choice can occur\n- Recommend using a Google Sheet template\n- Track version, OK/NOT OK/SOMETIMES OK, feedback\n- If using Vertex AI Studio, save prompts and track hyperlinks\n- For RAG, capture specific aspects impacting content\n- Save prompts in separate files in codebase\n- Use automated tests and evaluation\n- Iterative process: craft, test, analyze, document, refine, experiment\n- Template for documenting prompts provided\n\n## Summary\n- Lists various prompting techniques discussed\n- Briefly mentions challenges and best practices\n\n## Endnotes\n- Provides links to referenced materials"

predictability needed for trust/regulation; LangGraph supports anywhere)\n  - High floor, low ceiling\n    - Low floor: beginner-friendly\n    - High floor: steep learning curve\n    - Low ceiling: limitations, quickly outgrow\n    - High ceiling: extensive capabilities\n    - Workflow frameworks: High ceiling, high floor\n    - Agent frameworks: Low floor, low ceiling\n    - LangGraph aims for low floor (abstractions) and high ceiling (low-level)\n### Declarative vs non-declarative\n- Endless debate\n- Non-declarative usually implies imperative\n- LangGraph is a blend (declarative structure, imperative code)\n- Supports other APIs besides declarative (functional, event-driven)\n- Comparison to Tensorflow/Pytorch is incorrect\n- Many frameworks (Agents SDK, CrewAI) are just abstractions, not orchestration frameworks\n### Agent Abstractions\n- Most frameworks contain abstractions (prompt, model, tools, parameters)\n- Danger: Make it hard to understand/control exact input to LLM (crucial for reliability)\n- Hard to change logic without modifying source code\n- Original LangChain had this issue\n- Value: Easier to get started\n- Not good enough for building reliable agents yet\n- Think like Keras (high-level on top of lower-level)\n- LangGraph builds abstractions on top of its lower-level framework\n### Multi Agent\n- Agentic systems often contain multiple agents\n- Key part: How they communicate\n- Hard part (context to LLMs) applies to communication\n- Communication methods: Handoffs (Agents SDK example)\n- Best way: Workflows (blend of workflows and agents)\n- Agentic systems are combinations, not just one type\n- Building blocks can be combined and customized\n## Common Questions\n### What is the value of a framework?\n- Agent abstractions (easy start, common build method) - downsides exist\n- Short term memory (multi-turn support, threads)\n- Long term memory (cross-thread memory/learning)\n- Human-in-the-loop (feedback, approval, editing)\n- Human-on-the-loop (inspect trajectory, time travel, rerun)\n- Streaming (tokens, node updates, events)\n- Debugging/observability (inspect steps, inputs/outputs) - LangSmith integration\n- Fault tolerance (durable workflows, retries)\n- Optimization (evaluation datasets, auto-optimize) - LangGraph not currently, dspy is example\n- Value props (except abstractions) benefit all agentic system types\n- Framework needed depends on required features and willingness to build them\n- Understand the underlying code\n### As models get better, will everything become agents instead of workflows?\n- Tool-calling agents will improve\n- Controlling LLM context still important\n- Simple tool calling loop enough for some apps\n- Workflows simpler/better for others\n- Most production systems will be combinations\n- Both OpenAI/Anthropic recommend simplest solution first\n- Simple tool calling loop likely only with models trained on specific data\n  - Task is unique (enterprise use cases) - often requires platforms for customization (Sierra) - training SOTA models is hard, currently mostly large labs\n  - Task is not unique (computer use, coding) - general models might be good enough (OpenAI Computer Use, coding agents) - sensitivity to training data shape matters\n- Even pure agent apps benefit from framework features (memory, human-in-loop, etc.)\n### What did OpenAI get wrong in their take?\n- Based on false dichotomies, conflates dimensions\n- Inflates value of singular abstraction\n- Misses main challenge (context control) and main framework value (reliable orchestration with control and production features)\n- Specific issues:\n  - \"Declarative vs non-declarative graphs\": misleading, Agents SDK is abstraction not imperative\n  - \"Cumbersome as workflows grow dynamic\": true for complex workflows vs agents, not declarative vs non-declarative; use workflows when appropriate\n  - \"Necessitating learning specialized DSLs\": Agents SDK has DSL (abstractions), obfuscates context more than LangGraph\n  - \"More flexible\" (about Agents SDK): False, LangGraph is more flexible\n  - \"Code-first\" (about Agents SDK): LangGraph uses more normal code\n  - \"Using familiar programming constructs\" (about Agents SDK): LangGraph uses more normal code\n  - \"Enabling more dynamic... orchestration\" (about non-declarative): related to workflows vs agents, not declarative vs non-declarative\n### Comparing Agent Frameworks\n- Dimensions: Orchestration or abstraction? Declarative or otherwise? Other features?\n- Spreadsheet comparison exists (includes Agents SDK, Google's ADK, LangChain, Crew AI, etc.)\n## Conclusion\n- Hard part: Making sure LLM has appropriate context at each step\n- Agentic systems are workflows, agents, and in between\n- Most frameworks are just agent abstractions\n- Abstractions ease start but obfuscate context control\n- Agentic systems benefit from helpful features\n- LangGraph is orchestration framework with agent abstractions on top"
